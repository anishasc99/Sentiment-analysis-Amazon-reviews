  The phone seems to be owned by some shivang gupta earlier...he has all his details filled in...it's dishearting to know that an esteemed company like apple and amazon woul provide it's users a second hand device. This needs serious and immediate attention.Regards,Deputy directorBureau of Indian standardsMinistry of consumer affairs and public distributionMinistry of consumer affairs

  Pathetic Amazon service!! Don't buy online. My back camera has problem,  shows many green dots. Apple store is of little help. Amazon as expected,  is of NO help. Waiting to get this resolved. I preferred this over pixel just for camera!!!  Sigh!!!

  There is a minor Scratch to the glass on the front end it’s only visible when viewed in light properly it seems like a thread from cloth also when you touch that area nothing is felt . Is exchange of the item possible ? Although since it’s Amazon fulfilled I was care free that there would no Damage only after 2 days I was able to notice the damage although everything else looks fine . It would be great if exchange is made possible coz at the end of the day so much money is put into it . If not then I think I would not be buying any electronics product  from Amazon it better to buy from store co I can check everything on the spot .

  If you are an Android user who wants to move to iOS, then this is the best iPhone you can get without spending unnecessary huge amount on pro versions.I myself would have preferred OLED displays over LCD display on iPhone 11 but I just bought the iPhone 11. Trust me the display is very very good on this phone & with all the same chipset as the pro versions, there's really not much that you are losing.You won't regret this purchase if you want to start using iOS! Everything is very fluid & I like it a lot!! Don't think will be moving to Android in future.

  Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone’s features with the cost.The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a “Liquid Retina display”; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won’t notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ₹, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the “budget” phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones.Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately. Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79₹ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase “it just works” really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop.The one feature I wasn’t too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It’s safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the “soli” chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition.One of my favourite is the cameras! It’s Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won’t say too much on this topic as it’s well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings.Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags.I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it’s hardware.

  hiI had purchased this phone in first week of June 2020 trusting amazon.But this phone is defective, it failed to update, failed to connect to serversFinding no other solution, I used old version of iOS hoping it will work finebut it is not working fine, everytime it hangs and I am not able to worktoday while putting it for charging there was a blast in the battery and since then it is not workingI have just exceeded return period, perhaps my 70 thousand is now gone down the drain

  My mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try iOS. As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:Pros:A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]Somewhere between great to excellent battery lifeThe software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDICThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.Cons:Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.Conclusion with personal thoughts:Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV.

  First i would like to write about the Online Shopping Platform : AMAZON.Amazon is and i believe will be the best and the most trusted e-commerce brands in the country.Speculations and scepticism about whether or not, you should buy electronics from Amazon, will always be there.But my answer would be, GO FOR IT.I did buy this product from Amazon and it is AUTHENTIC.No doubts remain anymore.Well that being said, nothing is permanent.I TRUST IN AMAZON, when i think about buying anything from Apples to Apple Iphone.Keep it up.Good delivery, on time.Amidst the lockdown wave, starting 13th July, Midnight.I got it on the morning of 13th. So no complaints.Delivery: Good.Product Packaging: Very Good.Notifications: Good.Shopping Experience: Good.About the product, well you guys, know about it very well already.One stop shop for all my shopping needs.AMAZON is the way to go !

  Excellent phone so far. Bought it for more secure access. Fortunately amazon delivery this time was good (my past delivery experience have been bad).On downside, this phone is heavy as brick. Compared to similarly sized s10... this is too heavy.  Single hand use easily tired fingers and hand. Pictures are great but the wide angle is not good on people as it distorts edges in pictures. Speaker sound is also slightly mutted. Face id fails occasionally.I can live with most of the issues but the weight of phone is dissapointing

  Okay, So All QHD+ screen Android users like me, you will definitely notice a difference in the HD LCD panel for first 3 days of your new iPhone 11 usage but post that you will be use to it and wont be able to differentiate substantially.A 13 BIONIC CHIP was something new, wont talk about fastness or snappy features, just know that it wont lag under any circumstances.Camera is actually good and above all android users will find the output photos to  be realistic than what we usually used to see in ANDROID that means NO LEEPA POTI by default.There is a different depth that you will notice in almost all photos.Videos are Super Stable ++.Ultra wide comes in handy for good instagram shots.IOS takes a couple of days to get use to, like using whatsapp / other apps which have different approaches in selecting images from gallery etc. but its user eccentric.Battery lasts a whole one day , on papers its approx. 3100 mah but will get the work done.5w charger good for people who wake up at 7 and put their phone on charging.Built quality solid.Games run butter smooth, but not a phone for heavy Gamers.Once you get an iphone, you will automatically be tempted to enter the ECOSYSTEM, so get ready to spend bucks on Airpods and iwatch because TASHAN tabhi aayega. (also they work best together)Overall I would say you will feel missing out on ceratin features from ANDROID but you will feel plus in some aspects.And When you enter an apple showroom with an iphone in your hand, salesman jyada poochta hai. so you feel great!!All in all Buy it because more productivity and optimum usage comes when you play less games and work more with your phone.

  The Battery cannot hold up for long, also let me point the very obvious 18W charger getting a miss from the box and still isn’t up to the current Unix-Linux run, Google Android OS phones like Samsung’s A 30’s which cost about 12-15k come with 15W chargers..Camera: Night Mode is only useful if there is some kind of light it just can’t help but over expose the pictures and make them fee like they are from a Feature phone in the early years.Sound & Call Quality also NetworkSound is spot on both the music and audio or video calls are crystal clear.. I must add the front firing speaker was a great addition but what will make it more interesting will be if they can make the other vent for just acoustics into a speaker and have three instead of a dummy vent!Network with any kind of case on will have issues of poor and unstable connection.Camera:The Live Photo’s with the new hardware module just works superb with decent lighting. It wouldn’t take you more than a couple of seconds to figure out what should be your frame with the sensor throughly doing its job picking up subjects, colors, shadows and adding the Apple magic in every photo :PI would’ve preferred an Apple insurance or any warranty extension, we are all aware how the exchange and sale value on these phones are like lately!

  From the last 3 months, i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect. I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not.

  I am a first time and new iphone user after decades of Android ownership - Blackberry and OnePlus 3 this past decade. One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%. Battery life lasts easily 24+ hours. But then my usage is also minimal - right now I'm charging once in 2 days. Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.Overall user experience:Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.Don’t worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn’t you just need to use your passcode so it isn’t bad. For the most part it’s quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.Hope this review helps next buyer.

  The touch is intermittent...sometimes great... sometimes doesn’t respond. Heavy. Network receiver not working properly. What else to say... feeling cheated....After one month.....Now it’s been over a month since I have been using it and I feel that it’s the worst product from Apple. I don’t know what’s the reason but even after two updates, I feel that the touch is not working well and it keeps hanging on. The camera is not very wow but works well (looking at the price it’s not something really great...this much is expected at least). Also, the Face ID doesn’t work most of the times. And it takes more than 5 seconds to realise that it now needs to show up the regular pin/pattern to unlock. Even otherwise, I personally don’t find Face ID to be successful. To be true my four year old nephew finds it really easy to open this as he would keep my phone ready to capture my attention and would say something that would lead me to look at the phone unknowingly.

  The only word to use for this Phone would be ""Perfect"". It's a perfect piece of art. I was fed up from using android phones and just wanted to move to the ios Platform. I was confused Between iPhone X and iPhone 11 and after a lot of Research and Youtube Searches, I Chose iPhone 11 and trust me it was one for the best decisions of my life. The UI is super smooth, the Build quality is amazing and the camera is just beauty. I am just falling in love with this phone. Although its a little bit costly but trust me its worth spending money on this piece of tech.Pros -- Camera is Amazing- Water-resistant- 4K Recording- Fluid Smooth touch- Never Lags in Heavy Gaming- And 100s of more ProsCons -- Haven't found any yet !!!So if you want to Switch to ios platform from android then just go for it and Chose iPhone 11 as your next device.

  Bought iPhone 11 recently. I must admit - this phone is super cool. Design is good. Purple color looks fresh & soothing to your eyes. I was confused between mint green & this color but when i compared both at one of the apple stores, i just couldn't resist ordering the purple. During the launch of the phone, the new two cameras design appeared weird but when you unbox the phone it looks Stunning. Night mode is also too good. Looks more natural & true to life. This phone is a must buy!

  Bought it at 59k on prime day . Worth every single penny . If you are thinking about buying it just go ahead and buy it . I was an android user from the very beginning . My first android phone was moto g first gen then came oneplus 3t , asus zenfon 5z , and at last black shark 2 . Finally I decided to switch to ios since i own myself an ipad and MacBook pro . Trust me I regret nothing . The OS is so smooth like a hot knife through a butter . I am happy that i choose ios over android . I dont care much about customisations. All i need is good camera smooth os without any bloat wares . If you are looking for the same go for it

  This is my first iPhone. After being an Android enthusiast and loyalist for over a decade, poor Pixel design and besting camera of iPhone 11 made me switch to the walled garden. Coming from Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge I had my doubts on the LCD screen and low resolution, but believe me my doubts were unfounded. The screen on iPhone 11 is crisp and clear, with good color accuracy and balanced punch. I did a lot research comparing iPhone 11, the pro and max models as well, along with Note 10 and OnePlus 7T Pro. Comparing them side by side, iPhone 11 always came out on top in camera department - the most important criteria for me (which had made me choose S7 years ago). I also looked at iPhone XR, but the 11 offers substantial updates over XR.-----------------------************------------------------Here are the pros from the last few days of usage:1) Excellent battery life - I consistently end my day at 40+ %. All while I am still exploring the phone (and hence using it more).2) Dual camera system - the normal iPhone 11 makes the perfect compromise from the pro models - retaining the same primary sensor and wide angle sensor - I can live without the telephoto. Essentially the same quality as the pro. Pictures are true to life, accurate in color and great HDR. Low light performance is again top notch.3) A13 bionic and butter smooth experience. Never experienced lag free ui before - even 12GB RAM model Note 10 stuttered when testing.4) Promise of timely updates, straight from Apple. No OEM BS. This is an underrated and misunderstood parameter. I am paying comparable money for Android phones and getting latest OS after 6+ months and that too for only 2 years (followed by 1 year of security updates). Apple's promise of 5 year updates is reassuring - with increasing use of financial transactions on mobile getting security releases and bug fixes on day of release is critical.5) Build quality and design are unparalleled. Love the design - grows on you. Apple is a premium brand and you can feel the attention to detail in alignment of ports, ui elements, the milled camera cutout, etc.6) Gestures - Android does a piss poor job of this. Samsung's dumb implementation on Note 10 killed it for me. I don't need a split pill for the sake of it and call it Gestures. iOS does it so much better and in an intuitive style. I wonder how I was using my phone in now what feels like an archaic way through back button (and pixel's implementation is pathetic and confusing).7) Face ID is way more convenient that fingerprint and security unmatched on Android. I don't need to fiddle any more with my fingers to unlock and then navigate the phone. Seems Face ID and Gesture navigation complement each other to make a powerful and smooth user experience. I can navigate the phone instantly so my hands dont need to first fiddle with a fingerprint scanner and then shift the hold and focus to navigation. It's these small things that makes Apple what it is - a pleasurable experience.------------------------***********-----------------------Cons:1) LCD - The phone's biggest weakness is the screen. Don't get me wrong its an excellent LCD, only marred by lack of true blacks. Even then I am using the dark mode coz I like it.2) Photos app froze once for me when trying to share a large number of live photos on Whatsapp. Had to restart the phone to solve the issue. Hope this was an one off error.3) 5W charger - at this price it's fair to expect a fast charger, given the phone is capable of fast charging.4) Few apps that were free on Android are paid on iOS. I was surprised to find this. Nonetheless I bought the app as it was critical for me (didn't want to lose years of data from Android).5) Default zoom and text size make it difficult to read the text. Increasing either makes the screen seem less sharp.6) 3rd party keyboard - cannot be used in some apps. Only the pre-installed Apple keyboard shows up (maybe some security reason). This leads to poor trying experience. E.g. in the Outlook app SwiftKey never shows up. Can't get my head around this, as this breaks an otherwise smooth experience.--------------------************----------------------Final words - go for iPhone if you can afford it. Comparable Android flagships are way behind as an experience and complete package.***************************************Love the black color.***************************************Fun fact - tempered glass and case ordered an hour the phone were delivered the next morning and the phone was delivered late in the evening after continued follow up with customer care.

  This is a big scam. I received the iphone 11 yesterday and it turned out to be a defective piece . The audio doesn’t record when you are recording a video. Multiple other issues like phone not turning on even after being on full charge . So it says 10 days replacement on this. So I clicked on it and Amazon says we can’t do anything you should contact Apple . Apple says our service Centers are not having any slots so we can’t do anything you should contact amazon . What is this ? You torture a customer as soon as you make money . And that too for such en expensive phone . I demand a replacement for my phone right now Amazon ! Don’t play with people’s hard earned money . Guys stay away from this Apple days sale .

  May be my first negative review about the product & Amazon both. I was much elated to receive the iPhone 11 so fast, next day of dispatch i.e. 28/09/19, but the thing I got started heating up every now and then. Contacted Applecare, just to be consoled that it's quite normal. As it continued, tried to return the product by speaking to Amazon customer support but in vain. Some body called me back to convey that only Apple will decide which one to take back. Why is then Amazon took up the sacred duty of selling such an item which they can't exchange/ have no control ? The product developed new issues like proximity sensor malfunction and last but most importantly loosing mobile network every other minute(even had two software updates). It was handed over to the Apple ASP as the return window closed on 10/10/19 (what use it was for??) and diagnosed as having issues and has further been sent to Apple repair facility at Bengaluru. So I'm here w/out my first iPhone after using it(suffering for??) just a little over 2 weeks and the CREDIT GOES TO AMAZON !! Bravo, keep it up Amazon.

  My best purchase this year so far😍. I purchase most of the electronics from Amazon and this prime day sale was a cherry on top. Talking about the colour scheme- very pretty and different. Battery life is amazing, the display, the face recognition, everything is amazing. Iphones are pricey, but the processor and everything is just amazing. Please make sure that you update your iphones to their latest version for smooth functioning. Overall very much satisfied with this one. And this is my mom with the mirror selfie as she loved the colour and was very much excited to click. 💚

  Just after i switched it on, it started producing so much heating even i cant hold it by hand. Later i tried YouTube, game, normal browsing and it has the same excessive heating issue. Seems defective piece. I need refund asap. I have not paid 70k for a defective phone. I am feeling like got scammed.Edit - I returned this phone and got refund from amazon and bought the same from flipkart ..and it got no issues .

  This being my second Apple device. No, I haven't sold my kidney as I got this for about 58K. I have been an avid Android Fanboy using 1+ as my daily driver for the past 5 years. The switch using move to iOS and the entire transition using Drive, Photos etc.. It has been seamless. I may miss a thing or two about 1+ with what a stock Android would offer. Couple of my colleagues argued how good the latest 1+ phones are. Two things that 1+ will never be good at. Photography and Intermittent lag. Yes, a phone with 12 Gigs of ram lags!Now, off to the device.ProsThe device's build quality is amazing. The detail given in to every tiny little thing should be noted. Even the Sim tray is made out of metal.Speakers sound better than my previous phone.A couple of you might argue about LCD with lower resolution on the device. I certainly cannot differentiate that though. Color blind maybe!OS - There's no other mobile OS that is this speedy, updated on time basis and supports device for 5 long years. Yeah, you can root your phone and rock new Lineage OS on your Droid but the circumstances of rooting, Magisk cannot help Banking apps work.Camera - There are no other camera phones that are this good. Night mode is amazing. Such low light pictures turn out be so good. Note Huawei phones no longer have Google services yes you can sideload Play Store but that's still pain the arse. Next Pixel isn't going to be cheap either.ConsRemember an iPhone is always treated as an asset than a phone. Ask someone who has dropped his or her phone on a hard surface and the pain that it takes to have it repaired or replaced.Couple of them have pointed out that the device is a bit thick. Yes it is. Honestly slim phones cannot have more juice within. You have to sacrifice either of them.No 3.5MM means you can't charge and listen to music i.e. move on to wireless headphones.Overall an amazing phone that's worth every penny. And a phone that I'd be using for the next 5 years for sure just like my 1+ One The Legend. Electronic goods are always depreciating unlike Gold or Land and fits the needs of checking messages and making calls is all you need.

  If its just looks what you want then go ahead and buy...but its performance..then suggest you guys to back off.I observed back panel heating up issue especially while taking photos and using maps. [No, I have not put any additional back panels fyi].After spending 60K+ and seeing this kind of heating issue is completely unacceptable from a brand like Apple. I have approached Apple care [Service Request No: SKC4616] and they said they have to send the device to Bangalore  for further diagnosis. When I called just before writing this review, they are quoting they are not working today due to Sunday they are closed and blah blah...Apple wake up. Show some sense of urgency towards customer issues.Ok...folks its upto you to buy or not, just sharing my own experience so it will help who are thinking to buy this.

  helloPlease dont take any apple products online , especially if the seller is Appario Retail Private Ltd.I bought iphone 11 last month and suudenly today (17/08/2020) the phone got switched off and not getting switched on again.It was neither damaged nor it got wet in rains . I am very furious because i thought its an apple product and product will be robust.  My first impression on apple products is worst becuase of online reseller.This online reseller dont send the correct product instead they will send defective pieces or old piesces.My loss is 60000 rs. These people are worst and i request other guys not to take apple products from online or from the above mentioned reseller.

  This will help you more. See if you are planning to buy iPhone 11. I will say. Yes.But there are some plans I just want to disclose before you buy.1) If you are an existing iPhone X/XS/XS Max/ XR user, better you guys do not think it to buy. You guys have more or less better gadget.2) If you are an android user and planning to buy premium phone. I will suggest them to please buy iPhone instead of buying an Android. I bet you will never go back to android after using IOS.Now I want to share my 2 month experience with iPhone 11.1) Battery backup is 19 hours as I used it for 1 week.2) Mind blowing Camera. Best is slow motion.3) Very Handy. And look premium. If you have huge money then please go for Pro max.4) Display is more or less good. Worth it because it is not Premium display and you are not paying for 11 Pro max.5) You will love the sound when your phone is ringing.6) Front camera is awesome and must try slow motion selfie. That's it. Should provide Fast Charging.

  Please do not buy expensive product like iphone from Amazon, i had very bad exp, the charger cord was missing and had sound quality issues. Amazon initial told charger doesn't come in box and when i challenged it they asked reimburse the cord amount, but i requested a replacement, after some days they called me and informed that they dont take responsibility of missing items, and 10 day replacement policy they dont follow, you can read the email conversation attached  here where i mentioned every thing, i have the call recordings as well. At last they denied the phone replacement and even to provide the missing cord. For any damage or quality issues they said amazon is not responsible.

  The iPhone design is good and the camera quality is awesome. You can also take pictures in wide angles and the image quality is awesome.Phone got delivered at 9am on 28th September (I pre-order it on 27th September at 3am in the morning), I got my phone before the delivery date with nice and secured packaging.The overall look of the phone is premium and face unlocking is fast. I grabbed this phone with HDFC 6K Instant Discount Offer at Just 64K (128 GB Variant).Cons:1. The phone is great but if you use ""in the box"" accessories like ""EarPods with Lighting Connector"", then you might feel a little pain in your ears.2. The phone comes with 5W charger which charge your phone slowly. I recommend you to prefer using 18W charger.Well, I've never tried the iPhone before and I'm using this for the first time (Yes, I'm already using other apple products like MacBook Air & Pro).But the product is great and I'm just lovin it.

  Bought the mobile from appario retail ltd. Mobile is heating up within seconds and also camera modes aren’t working properly. Particularly in portrait mode, the stage light and mono options aren’t working properly.  i raised the same to apple customer care they confirmed that its not software issue. But the amazon customer care told me that they need a job card and report from apple service center. The nearest service center is located at 210km from my place, imagine the amount of strain and how much its going to cost. Before you buy anything from this seller just google it and u can find numerous complaints on this seller. What ever they sell u will find defective products only. There is a thread on this sellers dubious deals in quora. Please be safe and don’t regret after.

  Dont go by the negative reviews! If you want to go for iphone which can compete with high end android phones, this is the one. I have used the Oneplus 7T for 2.5 months (and sold it) and can say after comparison that the photos that iPhone 11 takes are way better than OP 7T. The battery has been performing really well after all daily chores, youtube, spotify, netflix, etc. I have last charged the phone to 100% at 9.12 pm and as I write this review (12.54 pm next day), I have got 30% left. I used to have an iphone 6s which I used for 4 years after which I bought the OP 7T. Now that I am back to the ios ecosystem, it does feel good! Also, trust me, the transition back to a Liquid Retina display from 90Hz does not feel bad, because Apple has really done a good job is maintaining a crisp and vibrant display in iPhone 11. Go for it guys. Haters will always hate!

  It’s just beautiful. The iOS is so fluid and smooth. No lags whatsoever. Camera takes awesome pics. The best part is the battery. It easily lasts 1 day and maybe more with fairly intensive use. I am moving from Android to IOS and I already know that I am never ever going back to Android again. The phone feels solid and sturdy in the hand.I don’t have any negatives to write about even though I really thought about writing some because a review is never fair without writing pros and cons. Go for it with eyes closed and you won’t go wrong. Go for a 128 Gigs. You will definitely need it.

  I bought this iPhone a week ago and although this might be a review done too soon but I know that this phone never disappoints. There are a lot of good phones at a lesser price like oneplus 8 and samsung s20 but if you want a a lag free experience and a simple OS performance - go for the iPhone.I also read a lot of negative reviews about the seller but it was a secured and happy experience for me! Appario did a good job here!Pros:1. A13 bionic chip - Smooth OS with no lags and top of the line processor2. If you're purchasing this for gaming - I did for PUBG then you won't be disappointed! The FPS and gaming experience is surreal3. Speakers are of excellent quality and are quite loud4. Camera does a more than decent job with the night mode being a stand out!Cons:1. Battery is one thing iPhone really needs to take care of! 3200 MAH won't let you go a long time without charging2. The LCD panel is not that great when compared to oneplus 8, lacks in screen refresh rate too with a 60Hz screen refresh rate3. The charger is a slow charger and takes around 2.5 hours to fully charge the device.

  I have been an iPhone user 8 years now. The battery backup is very much improved in iPhone 11. Performance is great.Highlighting an issue which happened for me but was resolved. May help others as well.After I started the new phone, in the initial steps I chose to set it up using my old device 6s.Post that the phone was super heated from a short usage, battery was getting drained and voice memos failed to respond after launch.Apple customer care helped a lot and eventually tried the option to reset the iPhone 11 and set it up from scratch as raw. Restored the data from iCloud later.Strange, but the phone now works like a charm as I mentioned in the start.Evaluate your usage and budget to make the right choice.

  After handling the phone now I can get convinced for the price as the make and user interface is really amazing but there are some corns for me because I am a long-time Android user so I believe it takes time for me to get into fully. The main concern is the headphone jack as we have only two options one we have to use lightning cable or Bluetooth headphones. Other than that it is really a great phone for professional users with a royal look.

  Coming from android and with no fast charging out of the box.... battery sucksCamera is awesome.... only pixels come close but this phone has an edge over every other flagship in the market.... portraits are the bestFace recognition works 2 times out of 10 in the post covid world and so yeah i miss the fingerprint scanner.Ios is 10/10 conpared to android. Gives you the premium feel.Display is something you wont complain about unless you do a side by side comparison with other phonesBuild quality is awesome but the phone slips out my hand a lot so use a bumper cover.No lagging issues..... phone heats up when doing heavy usage while charging but thats ok. All phones do that. Its a phone, not a super computer.Speakers- crazy good dual speakers but all flagships have that. Dont they?P.S. buy if you are a social media crazy kind of person and want insta ready photos straight out of your camera. If camera is not the reason for you buying the phone go for a one plus or a galaxy you will end paying less and getting much more.

If someone is buying the phone in 60k plus he or she should be given the things which is mentioned at least.

  Worth the cost.Battery  life is good. After 40hrs of moderate use 35% of battery was still remaining.The usage was with location,Bluetooth ,mobile data turned off ,wifi on and display brightness set for the lowest possible for viewing  clearly.Display , touch, faceid is good. Face id doesn unlock if eyes are closed.Camera clarity is too good along with night mode.Adapter in the box is not satisfactory. I have a fast charge capable  power bank and charge my iphone by using power bank. So 30 to 100 % charge happens in about 1hr.

  Ordered for iPhone 11 and received the very next day. When tried to switch on the phone, it did not work. Tried out it on charge and figured it had 0% battery charge! Normally it happens when there is a problem with battery or the phone which drains out charge even though it's switched off! Immediately notified Amazon and demanded refund/ replacement! Then we figured you can't get refund for Apple products on Amazon. However if the product is faulty, they will try fixing it or replace. Have not set up the phone yet as people suggested not to do that, else there may be further trouble returning the product. Confusing suggestions from customer care team, technical team etc. Suggestions: Never ever buy premium products, specially Apple products on Amazon. Will put together the whole experience once we know what's happening and share details.

  First and foremost, I would like to talk about the seller, as I have seen many reviews on Amazon stating that don't buy an iphone on amazon or from this seller. The product delivery was really fast and I got the phone within 2 days of ordering it. Got the 128gb variant for 65000 rupees during the prime days sale. The phone was in perfect condition and brand new. I was a bit concerned after reading so many reviews on amazon that this seller can't be trusted but I will advise you to go for it.Now about the iphone, The white colour looks amazing. This is my first iphone and I'm writing this review after using it for around 10 days.The camera quality of this phone is superb and low light photos are just amazing, don't even try to compare it to the one plus or the high end samsung phones, they are no where near the camera quality of this iphone.2nd Photo is a low light photo taken by this iphone.The Battery backup is decent.The Sound Quality is nice.Face recognition is really fast.Screen is amazing and you definitely don't miss the oled screen, if you are not a big tech geek, you won't even notice the difference in your day to day life.Overall, I am totally satisfied with my iphone and you can go for it without any second thoughts.Hope this helps ! ✌🏼

  Right choice to upgrade for iPhone 6/6s/7 user. Battery life is excellent. Presently it lasts for 36 hours for me.Camera- one of the best, if compared with other brand.Only cons- the phone box does not contain any separate connector to connect the wired earphone. You have to use the same earphone which came with the box. Otherwise go wireless.

  The best phone in the market for this price. I bought the phone before lockdown  and I am thankful to god that it proved to be one of the best decisions I took. You do not have to worry about anything, just charge it and the battery doesn’t not drain out for at least 12 hours. I am in back to back office calls for more than 8 hours. So this product is worth every Penny invested in it. This is my 3rd iPhone...iPhone 3GS, iPhone 6 and then iPhone 11. I change it every 4-5 years and must say the old phone still support most of the apps i have in this. This is a great investment if you value your money and time.

  I don’t think the quality of phone is good. Might not buy an iPhone anywhere else than apple store.The phone hangs few times everyday. Touch is not as smooth and its heating up as well. Didn’t hear all this from a friend who is using iPhone11 too. Must be a refurbished or low quality phone beng sold here.

  Before placing the order on the prime day sale, I was very confused about the incredible offers they put up. My neighbour shop warned me about the refurbished phone. But negating all the confusion and risk, I ordered. And I got a perfectly normal brand new iPhone.I am writing this review just to let everyone out there, OFFERS ARE REAL. Grab them!!

  I am a techno person and hard core apple and android user. Go through my review carefully before buying.I had iPhone 5s as my first phone.  It performed really well and ended up with dead battery. I had to switch to samsung M30 and no doubt that phone was some kind of rock made for a careless all day user. I used it for about a year and still its battery worked like charm for about 3 days of moderate use. (I dont play mobile games) This thing really amazed me. Still, a good battery is not everything. I was alway un satisfied with android UI and performance. And decided to switch back to ios.I grabbed this phone at a great deal. Delivery was quite fast. Once I had hands-on, I found that apple still have not worked on battery thing. Not really sure why. It seems to be draining a bit faster.  Will update the review after few months.Build quality is remarkable.IOS 14 is a magic.Phone seems a bit bulky and heavy compared to an android device of same size.Do not expect the premium feel as in iPhone X.I was confused between purple and white and chose the white which I think was the good decision.  Purple looks a bit faded because its light purple.Front and rear cams are remarkable for the price. Undoubtedly. Attached some samples.If you are a photo person, this one is for you.Final verdict : Blindly go for it if you are moderate user and not much into social media or chatting all the day. If you are someone in your twenties who stays online all the day or into a new relationship,  be ready for repeated charge cycles.  😅This is a premium device for someone with balanced online and real life.Do check out the attached photos. Hope this helps.Check the battery health once you get the product. Mine was 100 percent as expected.Thanks to amazon for the genuine product and intact packaging.

  So far it is good. But with lot of reviews related to heating up of phone I am bit worried. Few updates for iOS is required to be at par with android.Update: After using it for almost 3 months I could say that android OS is far better than iOS. Apple need to work on lot of things. I would say Apple should give android phones to their developers to know what can be added to iOS. Overall useless operating system.Hope with new release they will match with android.Those using android and thinking of switching over to iPhones please don’t even think of it.

  I have been using iphone 11 for the last 1 month & these are my findings:1. Battery lasts barely a day, if u use the phone frequently. Using Google maps drains the phone completely within 4 hrs.2. Camera quality is exceptionally well during portrait shots & low light shots & front facing camera is also good.3. Face recognition is blazingly fast but don’t work in angles.4. Display size is good, & fonts/text are clear to read, color representation on screen is good despite not having oled screen5. Charger out of the box is pathetically slow. I always use my ipad charger to charge the iphone 11, and it usually charges from 20% to 90% with the ipad charger within an hour.6. You need to invest on a good quality back case/cover & tampered glass to protect the phone (personally i like the Ringke case)7. Phone heats up sometimes during heavy usage.

  The iPhone 11 is probably the best value for money phone for people who desire flagship phones from known brands, until of course, the iPhone 12 is launched. The phone has great battery life, and a fantastic camera. The Chip is extremely fast and, as always, the iOS is probably the most user friendly UI available. The purchase experience was good, i got a reasonable discount, even though the no cost EMI option was only available on thee Amazon Pay credit card. I do feel that amazon is probably trying to encourage of their ‘in-house’ card and hence discourage the no cost EMI on other cards.

  Display is not at par. even after adjusting the colour settings. More of Yellow tint.Screen width is not suitable for e- reading in phone.Top notch is disturbance for watching videos in full screen.Keyboard is occupying half of the phone space.Camera, I think my expectations are on higher side.Side button disconnects the call and doesn’t lock the screen during the calls.However phone performance and sound are good.In my opinion I should have waited for iPhone 12.

  I am not impressed by the camera as it should be considering phones like Oneplus and google pixel 4. The night mode is good but other than this the camera does not have much to offer.Battery is okay.Processor is good. The size of iPhone 11 is 6.1inch which is more than pro variant.Overall average phone as compared to Oneplus and Google Pixel 4.

  Despite being a serious android user , after reading and researching a lot about iPhones , finally I decided to bought it , and to my surprise it turns out pretty well , yes the packing of Amazon was good but not up to the marks as this item would be considered costly item and so the packing should have been much better, the delivery time was good and intact I received it before only so full marks on the delivery process. Regarding the phone it is quite a thing to catch the eye with it’s mint green color and super amazing screen and the camera is a beast, the built quality is top notch and you will feel the sturdy product. Yes it’s little difficult to shift from android to iOS but once you get a hang of it then you will start loving it .If you really wanna buy a good phone with statisfaction then you can buy this.

  My first review ever in amazon. Dunno why ppl r so much furious about this seller in quota etc.package was more than perfect. Delivery was done with OTP to ensure it’s delivered to me. IMEI was shared to me right after dispatch and I checked the same in Apple website. It was genuine. Once I got the device and activated with Apple ID the device got registered which means I’m the first user of this IMEI device. Hence there’s no question of sending refurbished device.Battery is awesome. I upgraded from my old 6S.  Received this device at 56% by 11AM and after installing all the old apps, iCloud backup restore, one movie watch, 200 songs download from Apple Music, some 40 pics clicking - the battery reached 1% by night-8:30PM. Except iCloud restore and iOS upgrade restore other activities were through mobile data.Camera is awesome. Night mode is pretty great. The first pic here was with night mode and the second was with normal mode shot after two seconds. Both taken by 2:00AM.Overall it’s great to have this phone.

  User Interface is buttersmooth with absolutely no lag. Camera is just fantastic, you can expect an iPhone to do that but what blew my mind was low light images. Battery life stays charged for about 24hrs with slightly rugged use although I expected to be better. It seems like Apple has finally done what it wanted to do with the iPhone X. All in all, it sure is value for money, atleast for me.

  For me, its best at this price point. Upgraded from iPhone 6. Adequately fast and smooth with all day long battery life.Only disappointment was made the packaging, seller has just pack it into a polythene bag instead use of cardboard box for safety purposes of device and box as well. Box found damaged but device fount okay.

  Here’s my long term review on IPhone 11 64GB. I had ordered this phone around 7months back and this has been my daily driver since then. To give you a perspective I am using the dual sim in here reliance Jio as esim and Vodafone idea as physical sim. Both works fine and network connectivity is great.WiFi reception is Average I would say.Call quality is awesome one can hear clean and crispThe speaker is Loud and the music plays great I love itThe display is good but not great like my Old Note 9, but still colour reproduction is accurateBattery back up is good and it typically lasts a whole day.The phone is slippery so I use a back case.Nothing more to say about i0S and it’s updates they are great

  Beware of Amazon and the seller Appario Retail Private Ltd. Never purchase high end phones from online platform. The phone delivered to me yesterday was in damaged condition with vertical line on the screen.After contacting Amazon I was asked to take a note from authorised Apple service centre. Even after doing the same I was asked by one of the Amazon representative again to get one more letter from service centre. To my surprise, the service centre denied stating they never issue letters, other than the service record sheet. Still waiting for Amazon to process the exchange of iPhone 11.Horrible experience with #Amazon. 😭Rating of 1 star is for Amazon and the seller and not for the phone. Further I don't have idea for battery, face recognition and camera as I was not able to use iphone 11 and till now I have only bitter experience.

  Firstly thanks to amazon for delivering product safely and on time. I was looking to upgrade my iphone x was using it since 2018 was very much satisfied with it. And since iphone 11 was launched was very much confused wether I should buy pro series or else should stick with 6.1 inch line up people was sharing their thoughts that it's just an xr update with 2 dual camera. Which was confusing decision for me but I made my mind and got iphone 11 and I am really happy with my decision it saved my 50k for it's a paisawasool product for just one more camera and oled display it's not worth to spend that huge amount.Pros:-•Wide angle camera•Supports fast Charing•Stunning looks•Superb Camera quality•Safe and secure device •Flagship A13 Bionic ChipCons:-•The worst slow charger which apple still provide us 5w @1amp•Still have huge notch•Bit costly in India

  got the phone delivered within a day . Excellent service. But I guess the responsibility ends there itself.  the product is faulty .  Screen flickers ,  touch screen becomes un-responsive,  screen black out for a  few seconds is common and above all the  iphone heats  up horribly  to an extent that it made me uncomfortable holding the phone.  having read on  google now, it seems the product is faulty and heating is a common problem.  Fed up of liaising with Apple  & Amazon . hoping it will be replaced

  Due to existing COVID situation, my phone got delivered 2 days late. Amazon team ensured and took care of quality delivery. There are lots of negative review for buying iPhone 11 from Appario retail. Even I had my doubts but after having words with Amazon customer care & their assurance, I went for it. As soon as I received the product, I registered it online for validation. Even you should do it first. I had no issues with my phone. I rigorously used it for few days & only then sharing the feedback. Face recognition, camera quality, processor performance & battery life are way better. You will like it.Design is good, though the phone seems bit heavy.When I unboxed my iPhone, I found: regular Lightning cable, a pair of EarPods ending on a Lightning plug, and 5W charger. Though iPhone 11 supports 18W fast charging through USB Power delivery, it is not bundled with the new 18W Apple charger that comes with the Pro models. You will have to buy it (12 watt or 18 watt charger) separately, if you want to charge your phone quickly.  Some other good features: - Stereo speakers with great quality. - iOS provides smooth user experience. - The main camera produces very good photos, Night Mode works good. - Amazing video quality - Excellent selfie photos.Overall, I'm satisfied with this purchase of mine.

  I never go by reviews. I have done intensive research differentiating between android and iOS. I previously was a big fan of Symbian OS. No wonder the most robust system in those days. Then, android & Windows took over Symbian monopoly.I was accustomed with symbian but had no choice to buy Sony Experia smart phone as Nokia got dissapeared. I somehow wasnt comfortable with Android stock apps and the way the overall file system.I then decided to try iOS and I never regretted to ever switch back to Android.

  I have purchased this phone from amazon praying that i works fine as i receive the product as there is no return or replacement policy applicable for this. I am very fortunate that i received the product on scheduled delivery date in perfectly working condition and a most importantly a genuine one.Coming to the performance - i upgraded from iphone 6, so i felt the performance is super fast considering the 4GB ram. The camera quality is top notch. FaceId also works in low/dim light and is super fast and detects if your eyes are open/closed before unlocking the phone.The aspect i liked the most was was the notification message security, the message doesnt show up until u authenticate with faceid.The screen size is really cool.The downside i felt was with the thickness of the phone, my iphone 6 is super thin and this one felt little more bulkier. Felt even more bulkier after i added the case and screen gaurd.The battery backup is quite good, i got a whole day with wifi on and with some videos on youtube and calls over whatsapp and cellular n/w.Over all i give the 3.5 out of 5 considering the cost and the features it comes with. But remind yourself thats it an IPHONE !! You have to be ready to pay that much for it considering the quality and security that comes with it. ❤️ Apple 🍎

  I purchased this product during Amazon Great Indian Festival sale and received it at ₹47,999. It was a nice deal. This phone fulfils all my requirements as expected. Battery life is awesome. Face biometric is too good and light weighted. Please purchase a back cover for additional protection to the glass back. Screen is too big to be handled with a single-hand.Previously I used to use iPhone 7 and the major jump to iPhone 11 has been a complete worthy experience. Apple products are premium and are worth the price. Thanks to Amazon also for working with such reputable sellers who meet customer expectations. Overall a nice experience.

  Pros :-Great camera! The best ever. You don’t need to word hard to get the best shot. The image stabilisation is brilliant. The improved version gives you a perfect wide angle shot with option to increase or decrease depth in portrait mode.-LCD screen has no issues in performance and you will not notice any difference between OLED and this one. Bezels are visible but you will probably learn to live with it.-Blazing fast! This is the fastest processor/chipset so no lags in multiple app usage-Improved Battery which runs for good 15-18 hrs on medium usage-Games run insanely well with high end graphics-Wireless Charging-Beautiful design and ease of usage with a good sound reproduction from speakers than earlier iPhonesCons:-Wifi is slow and for some reason it doesn’t agree with 5Ghz band (which is the latest wifi version) so if you have 2.4 GHz then cool-Night Mode in camera sucks. One Plus 8 easily wins, even one plus 6T outperforms it in night mode.-Slow Charger in box still 5Watt so you have to buy another fast charger if u need. That is also slow ans gives you about 70% charge in 30 mins while on one plus you can get it to 90%-No 5G but still usable device as it will receive at least next 4 software updates-60Hz screen refresh rate. This is not a problem but Samsung and One Plus have upgraded to 90-120 and I don’t know why apple is being stupid on this-No screen guard or silicone back cover included in box-Best Photos need ambient light and poor performance in low light conditions. Tone becomes warmer and photos look more Yellow/Pale-Some useless pre loaded apps about 5-10Gb-True Black Experience is not there. OLED users who wanna switch might find it less pleasing.

Just to add one thing  it’s battery dies in one whole day after full charge. Though it depends you use this as personal or professional. I use this as professionally with high no of calls per day using this personally battery life I think will be much much higher as compared.

  Genuine review(not paid): I have been using the Android system all my life and this is my first iPhone. Initially, I was thinking that this phone is quite expensive but using this phone for almost 2 months, I can say that it is totally worth the premium price.The features and the user experience is amazing. The entire Apple ecosystem and the sync between different devices are remarkable. Helps me achieve more in my daily life.I am just hoping that Apple doesn't intentionally slow this phone down by software updates. It happened to me earlier when I bought an Ipad mini which started to slow down after 2 years of usage.Thanks.

  Worth buying! It’s an extraordinary device! The only flaw I would say is the display! If you compare side by side to Amoled displays this display will feel dull! But it’s more than enough for a smartphone m! The the purpose of smartphone are many not just media consumption! And hey guys all this will be noticed only when you compare it!What I say is don’t compare! Coz this iPhone is far far better in its performance and usage irrespective of LCD display! ..especially the photos, video recording, editing, ppt, browsing, everything you throw at it! It does with ease.. an EASY YES for this mobile..

  I had lots of expectation from this product but even just after unboxing and starting for configuration it started heating. It took 4.5 hour to recharge 60% bettery its very slow. I complained in the Amazone for return or replaced , they denied and ask to go to Apple service station for resolution. After checking at service station they says its normal and bettery will take 4.5 hours to charge its also normal. The bettery also drains very fast in4-5 hours. I have never expected such a bad profuct from apple like brand. And amazon is aslo not taking it for replacement. i simply wasted my money on brand.please never never purchase this product as even cheapest android will take not more then 1 hour in charging and will run for whole the day when new.I found few more customers like at service station complaining the same but they dont have answer and convincing them by saying same ' its normal'.. what a rabbish product with what a poor marketing from amazon...i highly discourged all of u not to buy this product ...Amazon is just doung marketing of this product they dont replace or refund ...

  After lot of comparison among iphone 11, samsung s20 and one plus 8 pro (As all three in some or other offer are available for price just under 60000Rs), I went ahead with iphone 11.It’s my first flagship phone and I am totally loving it. It’s camera capabilities are well known and I need not comment, can be used to make movies too!!. My average screen time is 7 hours, and a full charge a day is sufficient for me. 3 hours is required for a full charge and one can purchase 12W or 18W charger to decrease the time to charge. Face recognition works well even in dark conditions and is fast but it don’t work with a mask.

  Superb. It’s a no brainer even in Aug-20 when the iPhone 12 is so close to launch. I was skeptical about the screen but it hardly makes a visible difference between lcd and amoled screen in a 6 inch size. Besides the benefits of an lcd screen include cheap repairs, better battery life. I was using a galaxy s10 before which has the best display in any smartphone but happy with a mediocre display (with True Tone - which actually gives less strain to your eyes), Face ID unlock and an awesome battery life and the best camera in the market, I don’t think I will be needing anything else. For people who move from Android, yes the trade off is that you can’t multitask on 2 apps (split view) but for proper multitasking you anyway need a PC right ?

  If u have points and planning for not changing phone 2to 4 year that iPhone 11 is best optionIt’s my first purchase of iPhone from one plus 5T i am also thinking about its price but after some coupons and amazon icici credits point and cash back, it’s make me happyAbout iphone11Processor is awesome there is no lagCamera and haptic touch is very goodI seen heating problems in some comment I think those people don’t know how to use mobile data optionBattery performance and charging also awesome as campare to XRIt’s display very good and mr/miss siri is equal to alexa relative.So if you are looking for premium phone with best performance go for it and don’t worry about features like 5G.in india 4G services still not good and 5G will take 3 yr to fully operational

  I thought may be not good as android but I felt better than android.The user experience is good.Even then also using android for 6years I never regretted about iPhone. All the necessary features are there in iPhone.In terms of piracy iPhone is best.

  Guys I have learned that there are two types of screen display color in iPhone 11. One is with yellow tint and other one is blue tint.  And my phone which I got from amazon is yellow tint which is very low in brightness. Blue tint is good and brighter. Do not purchase yellow tint phones. Not happy with amazon service as they are not exchanging to blue tint.

  Camera is okay but not that great as it was advertised and we can not say it as the world’s best camera in any smartphone because Rear camera is more than good but the selfie camera is not much good. It has a quality which we can get in ₹30,000-40,000 range smartphone. So I will give only 3 out of 5 star for the camera and for remaining other things like processor, performance, battery life etc. “these are just great” and will give 5 out of 5 stars rating!!I’m just unhappy for the camera only!And I think this is the most unbiased review!

  After upgrading from iPhone 6 it feels quite good to use a flagship model like this. Camera quality is awesome, battery backup is way better compared to the previous models of iPhone, A13 Bionic chip is really powerful, if you’re a gamer you must own this device, PUBG,Asphalt etc runs smoothly in this device but the device heats up while playing games. We’ll go for the pro or pro max model if you wish to have a telephoto lens along with OLED display along with silver coating which feels premium, else you may go for this . I really welcome android users to have this device , it’s literally a beast in all aspects

  I’ve always been fascinated with iPhones but never bought one, due to lockdown I had postponed my shopping for few months but my older phones was bugging me a lot so I had to buy new one,At first I wasn’t sure about online shopping for iPhone but this pandemic left me no choice, ultimately I ordered after a long contemplation and I should say I’m happy with the purchase... I wouldn’t keep using it and then I’ll update my review according to my experience

  Actually, I ordered the phone (on 2 July) without checking the reviews, as I believed in the Apple quality and Amazon delivery (I am using iPhone since 2012). Later, when I checked the negative comments (around 15% of overall comments), I was bit worried, as all people commented saying they faced heating issues/camera problem/audio and sound issues. However, I received my mobile yesterday (7 July), fortunately everything is good. I will update my review, if I encounter any aforementioned problems in the future.I gave 4 stars instead of 5 as I had a lot of problem while exchanging my older phone. The delivery was initially scheduled on 6 July, the delivery guy was uneducated and didn't know the exchange process, I wasted my 4 hours for this process on that day. Finally, on 7 July the new delivery guy came and resolved the process.

  Alright, this review is going to be a little long so hear me out.First things first. Delivery was on time and the seller provided us with a genuine product. So thumbs up 👍  for that.Let me talk a little about the phone 📱. Out of all its siblings, this was one is the most reasonable one.✅ It has the A13 Bionic processor meaning it is one of the best in the smartphone industry.✅ All-day battery life.✅ A great degree of water & dust resistance.✅ Wireless charging✅ An extra ultra-wide camera✅ An extra SIM via eSIM (Only Jio & Airtel provide this for now)✅ The excellent iOS support that is guaranteed for years to come so you never miss out on the new and exciting software features.But confused about getting the iPhone 11 Pro and Max version? Well, you will be paying a lot more for the AMOLED screen and the extra lens camera. Otherwise, the phones are nearly identical.A high recommendation for this product.

  I switched from a realme1 to this phone so obviously i was blown away. The animations are so smooth,phone has premium feel, and its something u feel like u can carry around for the next 5 years.Playing games is on a whole other level on this phone , u can play with The max setting on pubg and 1 game would draw a max of 15-20 percentage. This isnt bad as pubg is a demanding game and running it on max setting is a very good deal.On the privacy side also apple is remarkable with its face id and permission mechanism.Every app is also 100x better than its counterpart in android as its very well optimised.Really awesome phone and i highly recommend if u want a phone urgently.or u can wait till iphone 12 :D.And Jus for a note..this last year flagship can throw the samsung s20 ultra and run circles around it on the performace level.

  Moved to this phone from samsung s8. Transition to ios is easy, however, I miss a lot of android features which are very easy to include in ios but for some reasons not implemented. Battery life is great. Camera is good too, however, i miss the raw support. A bit bulky and screen could be better. Hangs a few time which was not expected from iphone. Charger is too slow. Should be getting a fast charger with a phone of this price.

  The product is very good, color is also good no issue with the device till now as its only a day of usage, but this time i am not satisfied with the package as per amount paid for the premium product. I ordered 3 item but they sent it all together in a single box which is not acceptable. What would have happended if the product received turnsout a damaged one, i know there is a policy of replacing but it was a birthday gift, had to send back and had to wait for extra more days. Many a times i have received a serum with proper packaging with bubble wrap but the iphone came with a lame packaging. Overall happy with the product.

  I've recently made a switch from the Android ecosystem to iOS. I'm totally in love with the smoothness of the UI the iPhone 11 provides. The studio light feature in the camera is supreme for portraits. Battery life is mediocre as I was using OnePlus phone before this one but the build quality is excellent. If you're even tad bit confused on whether or not it is a great buy, I'd say go for it. Definitely worth the price. Also, the delivery was smooth and hassle free.

  I am writing this review because before deciding to buy one for myself, I was going through the reviews and there were a quite a few of them mentioning that people should avoid buying an iPhone from Amazon.However, since I had a gift coupon from Amazon and Prime sale was offering me a superb deal, I decided to go for it.I got the hone delivered the very next day. Packaging was good, however, expected a cardboard packaging, which was not there. Checked and verified my phone. It was a new one. No heating issue. Everything is working fine.The phone itself is great, superb camera, looks good, excellent battery life. Truly worth the price especially if you are switching from Android.

  Phone is good . Honestly I expected much more from my first iPhone . Deeply regretted after using this . Quality of camera , phone weight and facial recognition is not of a quality standard . I don’t have the option to return it . But if apple can make the changes or upgrade it . It will be good . Camera has too much noise in the picture quality . Blurred image is common in all the pictures . Facial recognition is worst . Even my sister is able to open . It’s a big flaw in the AI part of this . Need to change on this part .Overall not satisfied

  I always had an impression that iPhones are overrated and not worth the price. Was using OnePlus phones which where a bit low in price compared to iPhones and it is a great phone as well, but thought of giving it a go in this Prime Sale and ohh god, iPhones are surely amazing phones. The camera and sound quality is top notch.. Surely moving from Android to iOS gives you some trouble using initially but it happens while switching to any new phone. I love the phone, still find it a bit pricy but a great phone.

  I bought the iPhone 11 64gb red and I absolutely love it. The design is insanely good.Lot of reviews say that they received a damaged phone but that is simply not true!!The truth is the phone comes with an outdated iOS and you must update it. Or else your camera won’t be running normally or the video quality won’t be more than 360p( as it was in my case). But once you do a software update, all the bugs gets fixed.Also a lot of them seem to say that the phone gets overheated. I thought mine was getting overheated too. But there’a a difference between it being warm and overheating. The truth is it gets warm if you do intense processing. ( The software update took care of that too and I don’t know how).So don’t worry about buying a iPhone here. A lot of them are freaking out that their phones aren’t functioning properly and they were too quick to write a bad review. Truth is a software update fixes all these people’s complaints.

  MRP on product is 69k for 128gb variant but Amazon is selling for 73.6k saying revised price after April’2020. Is this justified?Also I have opted for 6 months no cost emi but when I see my credit card statement entire amount is due. Amazon now claiming that I have not opted for any emi option and asking me whether I took any screenshot while making payment. Such an unprofessional behaviourNow come to the phone-Everything is awesome except whenever you make call or incoming calls the network for that number dies and quality of call is terrible . I am using it as dual sim and not sure if it bcoz of this.Battery also taking too much time to get chargedMobile is heating after half an hour of use

It supports one esim and one nano sim.Great camera. Bulkier than other older iPhone models. Display and sound quality is amazing!

  Well well well! The most hyped iPhone of the year isn’t quite there at least not for me.It has a best camera undoubtedly, but the other side of the coin is not that good. So I was an android user, 1 Plus more specifically. I was excited to switch to the iPhone as most of you maybe. Amazon was pretty good at the delivery and I got it within 3 days. During my first day usage I noticed a slight warm feeling on the right side of my phone from top to bottom on the back. It was prominent and I could feel the heat that was generated. I looked online and fixed some setting like location and notifications which would put a lot of pressure on your battery. So i thought it is fixed but it wasn’t.To be honest I never thought of iPhones getting warm within a few minutes of youtube playback or social networking on WhatsApp or Instagram. It was all that I had never thought of. My onePlus 6 was a beast in this matter and half the price of iPhone 11, nonetheless I used it for a few days and kept looking for solutions but all would say it is quite normal for an iPhone to get warm.To be on the safer side I thought of replacement but Amazon won’t allow you unless you have a job sheet from an authorised apple service centre, which was quite new for me. As earlier no matter the cost of the product a replacement window was always open. A disappointment then!So with a heavy heart I headed towards the iPhone Service Centre some 15 kms away from my place. While reaching there I put forward my issues and they were like sir it is quite normal for the iPhones unless you get a warning of over heating. They were not ready to make a job sheet instead suggested for a diagnostic test, which came out normal.It has been a week now, I can still feel that warmth on the right side of my phone and I suppose I have to get used to it.Talking about the other things the phone offers, Camera quality is the best, you get some awesome video and audio quality. A top notch I must say.You will have to cautiously use it for a longer battery life.The charging brick is good for a normal user, it is a bit slow in charging but it is not necessary to spend some ₹3000 plus fo a new charger and a cable.Face recognition is fast but I still miss my fingerprint in times of this Pandemic.So the bottom line is worst Amazon Experience, you better buy it from an authorised dealer or go to appleonlinestoreindia for some good deals.And yeah! winter is coming so I have got it covered thanks to iPhone 11:) Cheers!!!

  Writing this review after careful consideration. I am happy with the product it is as expected from Apple.I will review this as per my experience from Amazon(service) and iPhone(product). I will tell write what I liked and what I didn't.Pros1. Professional delivery.2. Product received as described.3. Delivery received before the mentioned/dispatch date.4 Received a made in India device.Cons1. Amazon had prime days where it advertised the product for a price and changed the price the very same day.I couldn't purchase on 6th cause of their payment issues and on 7th they changed the price. Also the delivery dates were changed and had to opt for prime to buy the device. When I bought the prime subsription. The price had raised for the device. hence the discount nullified. As there is a discount on HDFC from Day 1 of 5000/6000.2. The day i had ordered the device the dispatch date changed to 1 week being a prime member in prime days. The second day it was changed to next day delivery and still I did not receive the device. I may not understand the delivery management but felt cheated.3. The prime membership that I was forced (by marketing strategy) to take was of no use to me for the product delivery in future purchases as well that month.Conclusion:If I had not fallen for the marketting of Amazon I would have given it a five star or at least a four star rating.

But this one is exceptional. At the same time, charging time is high. At least requires couple of hour to load and 100% battery.iOS simply awesome and flawless. Working smoothly!White iPhone is truly awesome and premium, loved it. Simply go for it.

  Frankly, i was slightly sceptical in ordering 50k phone from Amazon given the 10k difference vis-a-vis apple store pricing, mainly due to some critical reviews/complaints seen on the review page and partially due to people recieving surf excel packets instead of lenovo laptop - however these variables did not affected the product in any way :Positives:Price Point : Brought this at ₹46k during the 2020 Amazon Great Indian Festival.Fast : Apple A13 Bionic Chip is beaten only by A14 Bionic chipSecure : You close your eyes and face id won't unlock your phone.Camera : with wide angle lens - 4k video recording+editingGaming : I played asphalt 9 and experienced no heating issue even after playing it for 30 straight minutes.Ecosystem Benefits: only those having an apple ecosystem will understand this hence not writing here.What i Dislike:Depreciating Asset : Apple phones have very bad reputation when is comes to asset depreciation of ""Budget iPhone"" leading to customer dissatisfaction. i.e. the ones who brought this phone at printed MRP ₹68300.00 will feel cheated: they have lost ₹23k just by using this phone for 6-8 months earlier than me:

If you are shifting from android you will face battery issue. The charge is not that great as compared to android. But with time you will learn to use it properly.4. The face id works butter smooth.5. The dolby audio is something I am great fan of. The sound quality is something heavenly.6. The display enough smooth. It gives tough competition to the 90fps devices.7. If you are thinking to buy it for gaming, I suggest you not to buy this.8. The phone gets heated up after 1 classic match only in Pubg.9. Leaving the gaming aspect, without any doubt you can go for this phone.10. The vibration of this phone is just awesome. It vibrates with sound variation

The phone doesn’t really heat up except while using some heavy apps (once in a while). But not bad at all.The camera is great, as expected.Face recognition is awesome.

  To be honest, I feel like I paid the price for the BRAND only. Iphone is definitely 2 generation behind android. You can find similar specs (except camera) in mid range flag ships like oneplus series.I won't recommend you to purchase this if you looking for value for money because this is just brand for money.This is my first Iphone I was using oneplus series before buying this. I will summarize the comparison in an easy way.Camera = Definitely good but not the best (selfie mirror effect is annoying you can not change it in setting you have to edit the picture and then flip it, which not a good experience for me)Battery life = Good, can last a day long but also takes so long to get fully charged (I would advise you not to completely drain you battery keep it charging whenever you can)Overall experience = happy but not satisfied, Android has lots of small features which makes you life easy but Iphone is not offering those small features also android offers you to customize your phone they way you want but Iphone doesn't. Also it has single sim ( if in case it matters to you)

  First of all Big Thank You to Amazon for delivering the product on time and safely with good packaging. About the phone review, honestly I am the First time user for iOS from last 9 years am using Android and Microsoft (Nokia and MI) mobiles. The Iphone 11 is awesome in performance, battery life, and many more features. Camera I used but somewhere I feel blur while zooming, but it may be I don't know the settings I will test this and will update in future. Face recognition is excellent I will say in dark also it will recognise your face. The performance A13 chip is buttery, nice touch, color and build quality is premium. Phone is costly but at this Boycott situation I will suggest all Indians go to Iphone at this price range you will experience a new way but with premium quality and awesome performance phone.

  Battery life is not very good but normal use it works from 100 to 20 percent for 21 hours. If heavy user of mobile then 17 hours but u need to charge at least once every days. Camera quality can’t be beaten by any other device. It’s really best . Face recognition is best in mid night also.  I will give 98 out of 100 2 marks cut for battery issue.

  So, I got this phone on June 14, 2020. First impressions - It is a tad too big to my liking and very slippery. A Spigen rugged case is highly recommended.Apple should start giving different skins and themes to customise the phone. The battery life is awesome only if you keep it in low power mode. Else it will not last even eight hours. In battery saver, you can literally watch six three-hour movies. In short, a full day's work of keeping FB, Twitter, Instagram, Gmail, YouTube active can be accomplished.The charging is very slow. For a full charge from 2%, you end up wasting 3.5hrs. Apple is doing the height of chindigiri now by not providing earphones as well as the power adapter. What if I am an all-new introduction to the Apple ecosystem.I am not a fan of the camera or perhaps I am a bad photographer. Unfortunately I don't have any images on me. Lost my phone 😢. Booked another 11 though during the Great Indian Festival.

  Great Phone.  I have shifted my phone from iphone 6 S Plus to Iphone 11 (128GB Green).  Picture quality is awesome.  This is my home pic taken with (0.5x) camera option, it covered flooring to ceiling, really crazy with this. Remaining all features are TOP.  I booked this phone in Amazon from Appario Retail Private Ltd (seller).  He delivered my phone in on time. iPhone 11 is Little bit expensive but great selection from iphone.  Thankyou, RK

  This is my first iphone. After using android for so long didn't exoect to like ios so much. So yes ios is more refined compared to android. Iphone is costly yes but now a days highend android and iphone doesnt have much difference in terms of price. But when it comes to build quality, speaker sorround sound, camera quality, smoothness of ios, display even if in lcd i felt there is no comparison. Its just different league. I dont need customisation so i am liking ios better. But if u are more into customization thing then u may go for android. And final verdict.. Iphn 11 is a complete package and a real value for money. I really enjoy using it.

  Got this for unbelievable price of Rs. 51.2k for iPhone 11 128GB.... this product needs no reviews as it is the best iPhone available currently in non-pro series.. Battery life is just amazing... need to charge once in 2 days...Thanks Amazon for the huge discount...

  Awesome camera features, just like professionals! So many features, that I strongly suggest to check out tips and tricks video on you tube... so that you don't miss out any of the hidden features! They say that, battery is improved. But I don't see, much change. May be because of my use. Otherwise ok. And about face recognition.... I suggest you record your face picture in all light conditions to your phone camera. Because, if you record your face in bright daylight, the phone finds it difficult to recognise you in low light conditions. Rest All fantastic! Even delivery was lightening fast and well secured! The packet was opened in front of me (after confirming my identity!) and I was asked to check the contents before delivery. You will enjoy carrying iPhone 11. Feel proud & Go for it!👍

  I have iPhone 11 (Red)Battery: 4.5/5 ⭐️Amazing battery backup given that it’s only close to 3000mAh capacity. Battery optimisation is great. Lasts a day if you use Instagram, WhatsApp, Safari, Camera, YouTube and call for 2-3 hours.Camera: 4.9/5 ⭐️iPhone is famous for its camera performance in day light and night time also. It can shoot upto 4k 60fps from both the front and back cameras.Performance: 4.9/5 ⭐️iPhone comes with A13 Bionic Chipset and it’s faster than all androids.Never lags, no bugs.P.S. You can trust the seller Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd.

  Thanks to Amazon's ""The Great Indian Shopping Festival"" I got the best deal for this phone compared to other sites. I think I was one of the early bird to avail this great offer. It would be stupid to give a phone review for a year old phone but for me it's perfect piece of machine at a very reasonable price. Special mention goes to the early delivery made by the Amazon courier service.Thank you Amazon for this wonderdul deal.

  Great mobile for the price I bought during Prime sale for 46k(including cashback on hdfc card).Ordered at 12am midnight and received it on next day morning, so delivery was speed enough*Was quite worried about how genuine it'll be since Appario retail Pvt Ltd was the seller. But I have to agree, the product is very much genuine and you can check it easily by giving the serial number in apple website.Being the first time iOS user , I am quite enjoying the product and do not see any flaws till now.However mobile gets heated up a bit while charging (quite common).Greatly satisfied and happy for the purchase!😊

  So I got my hands on this beautiful purple iPhone 11 and it feels amazing.I upgraded from iPhone 8 to 11 and tbh the 3 year old iPhone 8 is still in the best condition .This is what makes me go for iPhone again and again .I’ve had android in the past and the thing that keeps me loyal to iPhone is that it gives me ZERO LAG and the BEST PICTURE QUALITY.

Phone had multiple issues such as WiFi, mobile network (no network for 10 days), facelock was working on multiple people etc in just 3 months of use.I have given my phone to apple service center and its been 10 days and its not fixed.STAY very careful before buying from this seller.Read mutilple bad reviews and I think seller is selling defective phones.

  I’ll be frank here.If you are considering the phone just for camera, go for Oneplus8 pro. It has a better camera.If you are looking for a overall satisfying experience, above average camera and Apple ecosystem, get this one.The price is on higher side and you can get almost similar experience with OP8Pro.Having said that, the phone is not bad.It has perfect size(OP8Pro is large), Performs good, Face ID is amazing, battery is good, fluid UI, no lags but the micro levels of tweaking you get in android are missing.Hope this helps.

  I like the phone. I love the camera. And iOS as a software is perfect. But the only issue I had with this phone was the weight and the screen. I would've preferred an oled display but seeing that this is a replacement for XR it wouldn't have been reasonable (That's apple for you).TL;DrGo for iphone XS if you want a good screen and that premium feeling and the perfect weight. Go for the 11 if you want the latest software and the camera upgrade.

  The delivery was fast it reached in 1 day. The phone as you know always the iPhone are best at camera,performance,sound and display.As it is a LCD panel I never noticed it is a cheaper panel,when using it feels it a OLED panel because apple has made it to such level it never feels inferior.If you are so much concerned about the display and notice a point-point of display then you should choose the OLED panel iPhones(e.g 12’s)The A13 Bionic is Beast.It doesn’t need to be described.The Camera,oh what should I tell it has the greatest camera quality on a smartphone.

  Switching from iPhone 6s, iPhone 11 was such a good option. As there were battery issues with iPhone 6s but there are none with this one, absolutely great battery life. Also, the camera quality is way too enhanced... it’s damn awesome ! Plus, not to forget about the face unlock that precisely detects your face even when there’s less light. Talking about delivery and packaging, I received the package in proper conditions from amazon & there were no damages on the outside or inside of the package i.e. I received my phone as expected ! Absolutely happpyyy with this purchase, Thanks Amazon.

  The 5W charger is really a pain....don’t know why Apple is providing it.It’s’ staking more than 3.5 hrs to charge the iPhone full and the adapter is getting extremely heated after 30 mins or so.YOU DEFINITELY NEED TO BUY AN 18W C CHARGER PLUS C CABLE if u want to get rid of this battery issue and be ready to shed an extra 5k.Rest I found an issue with the MEASURE app from the utilities section which makes the iPhone getting heated instantly within minutes of use.Anyone having the same issues ??suggestions are most welcome.

  One of the best iPhone at this price.No problem. No heating or bezel issue for a Norma user.Display is very fine and crisp. Not like normal lcd screen.

  Amazon and appario retail did a good job.I received a apple factory sealed package.But I found that the front glass was scratched mildly, running throughout the glass... That was disappointing since this is a factory sealed package , and it's the fault of apple. So Im taking to apple service.Other than that, one can save money by buying 11 instead of having a 12, also 11 has benefits of bigger battery, some what same performance and software, nearly identical camera. But Major difference is 5G and design.

  Using my device for last 20 days and it’s been a great experience. I switched from Android to iOS and it seems to be a good decision now. Battery, Camera and Performance all are excellent. Display is not so great when compared Oled display in 11pro but still it is better than many Android phones available in market. Face recognition is superfast in any light condition. Only thing that irritates here is 5W slow charger but it keeps your battery health better anyways in hurry situations I’ve to use 12W charger(bought separately). At the end I’m super happy with my phone.

  The retailer  is duping people. I got a dead product which is having motherboard issue. It doesn't switch on, just a dummy. The IMEI in the bill doesn't match with the device. Even the apple care representatives are avoiding us to buy from amazon specially during festive season.Basically the retailers are mixing the dead products  and other products so there is 50-50 chance you might get a dead product.

  Freaking pathetic when the phone was a defective piece and wanted to replace/refund.. they say contact the apple brand and when I go to them they say they don't have any connection since it was bought from Amazon and when I contacted the Amazon someone names ( TANMAYA) was in touch as customer service agent was trying to toss me around here and there ...and when I ask for a denial letter that Amazon and they claim they aren't responsible for this..

Not All data got copied3.Apple Customer Service was not great4. Samsung S10 is sleek, having 3 cameras, bigger battery.5. This is heavier & thicker than Samsung S106. No fast charging

  Worst ever! Battery health starts to drop within 3 months of usage. Camera for pictures suck when compared to OnePlus or other android phones. Phone gets heated up within 10-15 minutes of talking over calls or internet use. Apple customer care doesn’t do anything but say this is best IPhone ever and everything is good with it.Also, I bought on EMI for 6 months with HDFC credit card with a 5000rs discount but i have to pay the EMI for the full amount gets cut every month.

  Phone is a must buy but the 128 gigs.Display is fab. Even though it’s a LCD. The only down side is that it’s not so bright as an AMOLED.Camera wise it has the best lens. Even the front facing cam provides a wide angle.Upgraded from an iPhone 8 definitely worth the upgrade.Don’t worry about gaming everything is playable in ultra settings.

  Worst purchase for such huge amount that was spent. Camera quality is very poor, my galaxy s9 plus is much better than this one. Amazon doesn’t accept return but the options in the app shows return applicable. iPhone claims to have best camera and has large hoardings everywhere but in reality it’s not.Totally regret on this purchase.

  I upgraded from iPhone 6 to iPhone 11 and I am loving the new phone. It's very fast, has a great camera, and is extremely easy to use. The battery life is brilliant! The only thing that could have been better is the face recognition feature. Sometimes the phone doesn't recognize the face and you will need to unlock the phone through some other way. Otherwise, it is an amazing phone!

  iOS is easily the most intuitive piece of software you will ever use. I have used tons of different phones and software and this has hands down taken the least amount of time taken to learn.What's more is that you can use Siri to control the phone and every single app without ever having to touch the phone. The camera has also been improved to take crisper shots. The best part is the automatic night mode which is different from the other phones where you will have to tweak the settings yourself.

  Too new to rate. Some of the recent reviews were extremely scary for an Apple product and unfortunate that those customers were given bad products. Took a risk, ordered and told to cancel but Amazon force delivered the product. Opened and checked for defects, none so far.  Made in India, product is authentic! Thankfully not a refurbished phone. Verified the warranty, started using, so far so good. Will try update review periodically for your benefit.

  Do not ,I repeat do not buy iPhone from this retailer. My phone stopped turning on after 2 weeks of purchase . After giving it to the service center it had to be sent to Bangalore where it was replaced and sent back to me again. But I was without my phone for almost a month. My phone is working fine now but all in all it was such a hassle. Never buy an apple product from this  retailer called appario retail pvt ltd.Best to buy it from the store.

  Early impression: I am simultaneously using galaxy s10e , OnePlus 7t and iPhone 11.Looks- not the best from the front with thick bezel. But the purple colour back looks awesome.Screen- not the best when compared to the 1080 super amoled I have been using. But far better than pen paper specification i.e. 720 lcd.Camera-very good. Better than my other two phones.Performance- my OnePlus 7t is as fast as iPhone 11. However iPhone seems to be more consistent with uniform animation across all the inbuilt and third party app.Battery- better than my other two phones. However,the charging time is really painful after using OnePlus 7t. It takes around 2.30hr to 3 hrs to fully charge with the charger provided in the box.Sound quality- just as you expect from the top flagship.FaceID- the fastest I have used so far in a smartphone.Storage- got around 54GB free space out of the box. After removing few inbuilt apps(watch,garage band etc. )which I am not going to use , I got around 57 GB of free space. It should be enough for a casual user like me.Final vedict- got it at 46250 during the Amazon sale. Feeling better satisfied as compared to my galaxy s10e which I bought it at 51000 a year ago. Keeping android vs iOS comparison aside ,my iphone 11 beat my galaxy s10e in every aspect apart from compact ness and screen.

  I was an iPhone 7 user earlier. I switched to this 11 after my old phone broke. It is a superb experience while using it. Specially when you upgrade from old iPhone to this iPhone 11. The colour purple is awesome. I loved the look and camera quality is much better. Battery life is very well. Only thing is it takes around 2-3 hours to get fully charged. Otherwise best phone in market.

  Apple products are usually very handy to use. This is awesome phone with very good touch in operation and good picture. Bit disappointed with battery backup as it gets exhausts by end of day with limited application running in background. Many new features like in built scanner and full page screen capture is very useful and easy to send and share. Very good Face ID detection.

  iPhone 11 has improved the battery life. For me it goes up one and half day to two days with single charge. Face recognition is really quick and accurate. The best part is if you are sleeping none will have access to your phone by placing your phone in front of your face. Your eyes should be open to unlock your phone. The camera is really awesome. There are few modes which is really great line monochrome mode studio light mode. It gives fabulous effects on your photos

Didn't get much time to explore, however build quality and look of the phone is fabulous. Can't tell about the camera quality and other technical details as I have not used the phone much post delivery.

  I am a hard core android device user...But this is unmatchable device. I am expecting more and more from Apple. Truly a joy using everyday. Expensive at top class performance.Cons: Charge is very slow. Could have provided fast charger. For me doesn’t matter to spend a little more but I expect everything in single box.

  I've been cheated for ₹60000/- for this product by Amazon by sending me a handset which had manufacturing fault. The fault was well pointed out by Apple's authorised service center. While contacting customer service on numerous occasions they made to wait for more tha  a month and after a month they said 'sorry sir, we can't help you'. Handset is useles lying in my cupboard.

  I’m very impressed with iPhone 11. It’s battery life is so awesome and camera quality is dope. Let’s talk about Face recognition it has the fastest Face ID recognition I have ever seen and it has the fastest chip A13 Bionic inside so don’t worry about performance. I’m 100% satisfy with the product.

  Brilliant design and good responsive phone. I bought this for my father and he is thoroughly enjoying using it. Amazon delivery was quick and product arrived in a perfect condition.

  It takes 4hours to charge and 5-6hours running time. Present time nobody can wait 4hours just to charge a phone on airplane mode otherwise bot phone and charger can overheat. Not so satisfying charger and battery. So many brands are far ahead in the same price. Color is light lemony instead of yellow.

  Got it in 10 days during the pandemic semi-unlock days. Back looks great, front is fairly nice too. Apple makes premium products. Just that the weight and breadth of the phone is a bit old age now, shifting from a slim-trim oneplus5t to this, you'll have to have a tighter grip . Nevertheless, Photos are amazingly beautiful. Great buy.

  Its my first Apple product I have ever bought, and ngl, its absolutely worth it. Been using it for more than a couple of months, the phone never did disappoint. Excellent performance with one of the best camera and picture quality, super efficient RAM management, clean look, and frequent software updates, always a big yes-yes.

  After 2 day of use i found worth it Camera quality is very good before buying I’m bit worried by reading reviews about heating issue and hanging issue, at first time charge phone bit heated but manageable after that no heat issue as such I haven’t played game coz not a fan of games and all. Battery backup is also decent. Only drawback i see is that at this huge price only 5w slow charger is provided

  Sometimes a minor fault is coming in settings it may be due to the app we installed or the network but I’m not sure about anything. Rest all are good but expensive.

  Today finally I got my iPhone 11, but it doesn't go well as expected, the ringtone volume goes off as it rings, not audible and even while on phone(on conversation) it needs Loudspeaker on to make the sound audible. I am going to return this iPhone to the Amazon and i suggest you friend don't buy this phone as most of iphones have some or less problems.

  The technology used for face recognition while it is good it possess huge challenges. If the phone is closer to you the phone ring volume reduces automatically. This means, you wouldn’t get phone ring and end up missing calls if you are watching any pictures, emails or videos. This is a huge issue for users

  Excellent Product. Now you can give away your kidney instead of actually paying for the phone. Two amazon certified surgeons came at my place. The operation for my kidneys was beautifully done and then I received the phone. You can also transfer intellectual property through amazon pay now. That could be one of your options. In my case, I did both, LMAOO.

  Please don't buy iPhones from iphone.. If you want to buy please go to apple store. Don't think for extra 3k when you buy from apple store. See the 1 star reviews, they are not lying. Think about them.. Buying an mobile atba cost of 70000 and the product is defective, if you ask a replace in amazon, they won't replace the product. They will direct you to apple store. When you go to apple store they will not help the customer who bought a product from amazon, now you can't do anything. The 70000rs is just a waste. Please don't buy iPhone from amazon. Just go to apple store and buy. Yes apple store don't reduce the price.. But if you buy a iphone from apple store and you got a problem they will help you.. If can't they will replace your mobile free of cost. Think about it.. Buying a iphone less for 3k and got a problem, you have to suffer and waste of time for you. I am not telling all the iphones are defective in amazon. Some product and some particularly some seller making the mistakes, they are knowingly making the mistakes. Please but a iphone in apple store.

  Upgrading from iPhone 7 Red 256GB to 11 is nothing short of exciting to me!Pros:1. Camera. CAMERA! Night-mode! Wide-angle!2. Battery life. No one told me that iPhone batteries last more than half a day. This one does for a FULL day!3. Performance. Phenomenal! I run mobile games on full graphics and the phone does not break a sweat!4. Software. Apple should be lauded for iOS. No bloatware, no lags, no over-the-time performance decay!5. Screen. Even though this has LCD, Apple has done a phenomenal job in making it the best available right now.6. Build Quality. Do I need to say anything about Apple's this aspect? Premium! Phenomenal!7. Design. Truly professional looking compared to the Pro/Pro Max gas-stove looks!Cons: (I'm nitpicking, believe me you!)1. No fast charger in the box. What a dud for such an expensive phone!2. Could have come in OLED at this price-point.

  well size  and its all colour is very good design is very good  features.but one thing is same according to me the camera quality  of 8 plus and  iphone x and 11 almost same but design is too good battery life too good  it consist alll the things but it also affects our pocket . on the other hand every thing is excellent no issuebut one problem is that after some time why battery is affected  I dont know why  but its a true fact.all products of apple is very good  i have no words to complement  all goooooooooooooooooood

  Yes it’s iPhone and iPhones are good. iPhone 11 is my first one. Different UI from android phones, So takes little time to adjust.1. Camera is one of the best in class i would say, mind blowing details in photos2. Battery life is awesome, i hear the older iPhones never used to have battery backup like this one, well if u were an android user then they had good battery backup mobiles3. Sometimes I see lag Especially the iMovie4. Face recognition is really good5. There isnt any lag in games i played, not high def games thoughI am Totally satisfied with its performanceiOS 14 on the way so sit tight, fingers crossedThanksGod

  May be my first negative review about the product & Amazon both. I was much elated to receive the iPhone 11 so fast, next day of dispatch , but the thing I got started heating up every now and then. Contacted Applecare, just to be consoled that it's quite normal. As it continued, tried to return the product by speaking to Amazon customer support but in vain. Some body called me back to convey that only Apple will decide which one to take back. Why is then Amazon took up the sacred duty of selling such an item which they can't exchange/ have no control ? The product developed new issues like proximity sensor malfunction and last but most importantly loosing mobile network every other minute(even had two software updates). It was handed over to the Apple ASP as the return window closed on 10/10/19 (what use it was for??) and diagnosed as having issues and has further been sent to Apple repair facility at Bengaluru. So I'm here w/out my first iPhone after using it(suffering for??) just a little over 2 weeks and the CREDIT GOES TO AMAZON !! Bravo, keep it up Amazon

  Although I dint buy it from amazon but I’ll still tell u how good it actually is! I’m a college student and a heavy user. My day begins at 5 when I put my iPhone 11 on charge and i remove it at 92-96% of charge. I read books , listen to music , play cod and Pubg along with clash Royale watch YouTube and listen to music. My day ends at 2300hrs and I’m always left out with approx 32-46% battery. The standby time is just great no battery drains when not in use and I mean it ! No battery drains. That A13 Bionic is just a beast and let’s just not talk about the performance. A true destructive amazing fast performance is always guaranteed. I have no regrets reshooting from android to this phone! Buy it and enjoy it guys!

  After using iphone11 for months, these are some problem I am facing. I don’t know if it’s software or hardware problem.Problem with Iphone 11 are1.Sometimes it doesn’t recognise face to open the lock, need to restart the iphone to solve this problem.2.It gets hang sometimes, then gets restarted automatically.3.Dot appears in photos taken in sunny day due to its camera lens.4.Front sensor doesn’t work accurately.Because of these problems, I think it’s not worth buying such expensive mobile. Disappointed 👎🏻

  The seller and Amazon, both have been unprofessional and the replacement policy clearly needs a revision.I was unlucky as I recieved a faulty handset. After several calls between Apple cusotmer service and Amazon I realised I am duped for 70,000. Amazon won't replace unless I give them a letter from Apple and Apple won't replace anything as I purchased the phone from Amazon. I've to travel 40kms to get to a Apple store for the letter Amazon wants. They won't trust the consumer and stick to their policy which is not fair on consumers. 0 consideration shown in such unprecedented times and no room for exception. I wouldn't recommend buying phones from this seller and Amazon due to the pathetic replacement policy.

  I am honestly telling if you are willing to spend this much amount then please go and purchase from the store i received defective earphones when called amazon got rejected for service then they said they can’t do anything in it please go to service center . Do not fall into cashback traps for 2-3k rupees you can received defective default or used phones. And when you complain about this you will hear this “hello sir sorry but we cant do anything” So please spend 2-3k and buy from store atleast you will be satisfied

  A great phone which can handle all big gaming apps very smoothly, camera is even great, battery will get a day and even many more pros as people mentioned in reviews.Single CON:Those who are upgrading to this phone who had amoled/oled phones, you will easily notice the difference in display quality.Before buying this phone go to any shop and check same youtube videos(1080, 4k,8k) comparing along with your amoled/oled phones and if you are ok then go ahead and buy.  This lcd is far better than other lcds in market but in market almost all phones have amoled/oled displays so think twice and buy(this is only for amoled/oled users)For other users blindly buy this phone

  Its been a month i have been using iphone 11. Here is my honest opinion.Pros:-Excellent battery life. I have been using samsung galaxy s9 and its battery life sucks. Iphone 11 really made me change my mind about battery life in a smartphone. Its just amazing. Easily lasts over a day of heavy usage. Just outstanding. If you want a long battery life just go for it- Excellent cameras. God damn the pics from this phone are gorgeous. Ultra wide camera is good to play with. Night mode is stunning. I would say its the best in camera department- Performance. No matter how much RAM android phones have, iphones are beast. No android phone can ever beat iphone in term of performance. Such flawless and smooth buttery performance. Just wow.Cons:-Display: it’s disappointing to be frank. Coming from an oled family, you can seriously tell difference. Its nothing compared to oled display. Very disappointed with the display.-Charger: it takes 3 hours to charge this phone from 0 to 100 and seriously its a hell lot of time. Just throw away the box charger and get a fast charger-Network: connectivity sucks in this phone. I never get more than 50 percent network coverage as comparing to samsung galaxy s9. Apple should really take this seriouslyConclusion:Its a beast of a phone. Upgrade if you are coming from lcd panel’s and want a phone with great battery and camera.If you use phone a lot and screen quality matters go for pro version. Coming from oled panel to iphone 11 would be disappointing.

  Bought this as a gift, rear camera is DSLR quality but front camera is defective. It is clicking very dark pictures with yellow/tan tint. Reached out to Amazon and they aren't able to help, btw bought this from appario retail and again I did read some bad reviews for this seller but chose to ignore since it was iPhone. Turns out I shouldn't have, they might be shipping defective products. Now we are reaching out to Apple support to replace this, which is a big time consuming thing amid lockdown where you have to take token to visit the store. Buy it from Apple store instead.

  It was my first iphone and What a TERRIBLE experience!!! The mobile stopped working  after 3 weeks usage. Not getting switched on and no response to charging. Amazon service replied that the return window is closed. Apple service said they had similar complaints from mobiles purchased online and gave appointment 2 weeks later. Don't know whom to blame, the seller, Amazon or the Apple Inc. itself.  Expected better from iphone. TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED!And who enables the phone to have a fast charging capacity and asks us to buy the fast charging adapter separately for 1700? Who says it has dual sim and asks us to roam around to get an esim?

  It's value for money,  Build quality, design and looks of the phone is awesome.Camera performance is brilliant. Transition from Photo mode to video is marvellous. Lo light photography is speechless. Battery performance is much better and phone does not get drained out quickly. Fast charging is commendable though it doesn't come bundled with fast charger.Ninth, I am missing notification LED light.Weight of the phone is heavy. Given the price point it's really value for money and I love it.

  I bought Apple 11 for my mom. Here's my understanding of the device:Pros:1. Battery life is really good.2. My mom is an android user. I didn't find her getting uncomfortable with the UX, so it seems they have made it pretty easy to learn, even to the pre-conditioned users.3. They have simplified camera and photography. Instead of choosing the filters during the click-time, they have kept it during the viewing time, so that appropriate filters are chosen.Cons:1. they have removed the 3.5 mm adapter. Apple is turning greedy.2. Their gestures to go to home screen is a bit confusing at first. They should simplify such things.3. Instead of informing what's new in the apps, they should tell how to use in the first run of phone. This would help users get accommodated to the device quickly.Overall, the phone is good, and has bigger screen than iPhone X (which I own). It's a bit difficult to handle from one hand, especially for the smaller sized palms, but that's how things are now.I would recommend this phone to others as well.

  The camera setup is itself a attraction and the fast and reliable faceID just steals my heart.The phone is super fast. It serves well for a whole day in one full battery charge.The iPhone 11 is an awesome piece of machine used for the day to day mobile usage. It is a beast for the android and the first love for the iPhone users.The battery is improved a lot and the camera setup is awesome.The option of different colors make it very choice of one to choose from.However I am comparing it below:-Differences from iPhone 11 pro1. Only two cameras but they serve the purpose well in 11.2. The battery is better in iPhone 11.3. The screen quality is a bit on lower side in iPhone 11.4. Processors and the charging procedure is same.5. You don’t get a fast charger with iPhone 11.Compared to iPhone XS.1. The processor is way better in 11.2. The screen quality is on lower side than XS.3. The battery life is very much improved in 11.4. Of course it is a must upgrade from XS.

  Upgraded from the iphone 10 and i can clearly see a huge difference between the display. The oled on the 10 was much better than this lcd or as apple calls it the liquid Retina display.The battery life is superbly good easily lasts an entire day for me with 5-6 hours of screen on.The cameras perform really good even in low light, the new night mode on the 11 works flawlessly, you can see a drastic difference between the picture taken with and without the night mode turned on.I really dont need to talk about the A 13 bionic because we all know apple has the best processors in the industry, the 4gb ram is more than sufficient for this beast. The phone is much faster and smoother than my galaxy s10 plus which has 8gb ram.Its a great value for money phone with an okish display and astonishing performance and superb cameras. The red colour is really eye catching and attractive. Apart from the display I didn’t see any other flaw is this phone.

  Please don’t buy iPhones from amazon they are selling defective devices & when tried for a replacement they are not accepting instead asked me to check with Apple authorised service center! The phone started malfunctioning from day 1 the camera struggles to focus the call quality is worst & finally the mic is not working! I don’t have belief in amazon on expensive items! Thank god it was under Indian warranty & thanks to Apple for replacing the phone immediately (offline) had to go direct to their centers!Don’t buy from amazon goto Apple authorised reseller!

  Good phone, but now apple is just not worth for the price you are paying. They are priced like a joke. Even the Oneplus 8 Pro is cheaper than the iPhone 11 in India, and its camera is comparable to the 1lac+ iphone 11 pro. They should start reducing their prices.

  It’s been 6months m using this device. I upgraded from 8 to 11. Here’s my short review:Camera quality: great due to dual camera sensor. Optical zoom just captures superb angles and picsBattery duration : this is the biggest advantage of this iPhone is . I don’t always carry my powerbank with me :D :D that’s the biggest relief for me ( my iphone 8 gave me headaches regarding this issue)Face sensor : this aspect needs serious improvements as I feel it’s laggy often. I prefer the hand touch sensors more.This is a pretty awesome cool iphone. Go for it as the size, performance, camera and most of the all : battery will never put you down

  Better to go with some other brand. I have Iphone 11 and I have invested approx 70,000 in this phone. I am facing issues with the charging cable which is in warranty and when I visited apple service center then they are saying it is not cover under warranty.I believe quality of Mi service Center is far better than apple service center.

  First of all idk why Amazon is charging 68k for this when I bought it it was 64,900/- which was the on box MRP. Plus, the phone is average like the camera isn’t that great as I expected it to be and it’s sad that Apple has kept most of the specs basic. The dual camera on the back is almost useless I don’t use it. I would’ve gotten an XR and saved my money instead. Battery life is great, sound is amazing but price wise I think it’s too much

  Ive had my phone for about 2 months now and I love it. I bought it despite the fact that i have a one plus 6t.Now the first few things that are noticeably better are1. battery life - Two days solid on low power mode - best ever2. display - now hear me out. yes it might appear to be a bit washed out on the colors on the iphone...  but there is no flickering at all. if u use the lcd and go back to an oled it strains / hurts your eyes. The oled can sometimes get too vibrant and inaccurate.. even though it looks better it need not necessarily be better in all aspects. And oled's have a lower life expectancy comparatively to lcd's because of screen burn in. ive had 3 iphones in the past 4 , 6 , 7plus and all work just fine even till date!!.. but a few oled iphones (first launched in 2017)  have already started burning in.3. design , camera , performance , OS - the best - in my opinion.4. the only downside to buying this is that you get an old 5 W chagrer in the box, which is super annoying but yeah nothing unbearable. u can get an apple fast chager for about 4.5 k and be sorted AF.love the iphone 11 - thank you Apple.

  IS IPHONE WORTH IT ?let me say, it's not about iPhone or others, it was buying into a product which will be able to meet my needs and give that quality output, last year on my birthday I bought this iPhone red 128gb , which I tried multiple times buying but failed because it was always out of stock! frustrating as it was, I knew I wanted this, for the reasonI am a youtube known as WHAT THE DUDE, I make videos on men health to tech and I needed something which was handly and could should 4k! and iPhone 11 WAY ABOVE MY EXPECTATIONS,I bought it to shoot, review and make contents, and this phone has not failed me yet, I went through accidents also last year on the bike and this is durable!the battery is great, i charge once a daynow after a year when i am using youtube, Instagram, Facebook, making 1080p videos, clicking images, transferring them, all while the background apps are open i charge i every 8-10hrs, may i tell you i have not activated battery saver modethe phone is a class on its own, you can see its review on my channel and if you like you can follow me on amazon on more genuine reviewsthankyou

  The iPhone design is good and the camera quality is awesome. You can also take pictures in wide angles and the image quality is awesome.I got my phone before the delivery date with nice and secured packaging.The overall look of the phone is premium and face unlocking is fast.Cons:1. The phone is great but if you use ""in the box"" accessories like ""EarPods with Lighting Connector"", then you might feel a little pain in your ears.2. The phone comes with 5W charger which charge your phone slowly. I recommend you to prefer using 18W charger.Well, I've never tried the iPhone before and I'm using this for the first time (Yes, I'm already using other apple products like MacBook Air & ipad.

  I was using android since the birth of smartphones, never tried IOS and was bit sceptical about iphone because of different miths about it, customisation is the one to name some. The other reason for not purchasing iphone is the price but this time apple did a great job in pricing, it launched iphone 11 at a decent price like not too cheap but not too expensive, I won’t say it is not overpriced, indeed it is because we can get a good flagship category android phone at a much lesser price. Well lets get to the pros & cons:Pros:1. Great Camera2. Best processor in the Industry - A133. Good battery life for average user4. Secured Phone because it is IOS5.  Smooth experience overall6. Water ResistantCons:1. Battery life is not sufficient for an heavy user.2. Not a OLED screen which is must at this price, but still it doesn’t make a much difference for day to day use3. The in box charger is pathetically slow just 5watts4. The Notch is still the same size with thick bezels which makes the design a bit outdated.My final verdict will be buy this iphone only if you are already an iphone user or if you want a full proof secured phone otherwise there are plenty good options in Android industry naming Samsung Galaxy S20 & Note series.

  I purchased iPhone11 in 70k but never had disappointment with iPhone. I was the user of iPhone6s initially. My iPhone 11 is very bad in WiFi. It’s damn slow and most of the time app and Webpage won’t load. Same WiFi works fine in my other mobile and iPad also. Tried everything like format reset etc etc. called to customer care but they are not talking as issue and saying your WiFi may be slow. If WiFi is slow then how it is working fine in another mobile and iPad . Worst service from Apple. Now onward will not recommend iPhone to anyone

  After using 5s for 6 years which is still working I updated to this. Loving it. Best part of apple products is that it will give you real performance, I mean why to have a camera which over exaggerates the pictures. For that we have editing software in the phone. User interface is mind blowing. I can control each and every notification unlike in high end android phones. The display is at par with most expensive android devices. Speed is much better than any high end android.

  It is an iPhone and lives up to the Brand and associated hype. My teenage daughter used the previous 6s for 5 years!  The item was in perfect working order and was a fresh unused piece. warranty was not activated previously. The seller was Appario so felt safer. Picked one for 59K during a price drop.

  I am pleasantly surprised by its battery life. Once fully charged, i didn't feel any need to recharge it again in a day. The iphone 11 as a whole package is really good. I have been an android user and switching to iphone didn’t disappoint me. As far as iphone camera is concerned, i found it a bit less effective /good than google pixel camera . Google pixel camera was outstandingBut Nevertheless, a good buy

  This is my 7th iPhone since 2009 and each purchase really amazes me. The quality and the ease of use - this is something we cant get from any other mobile manufacturer. Even though the customer care is a bit of let down, i would say the product quality is quite good so you seldom need any customer support.

  It’s been more than 1 month being IPhone11 user. To be frank, it’s a mind blowing experience of premium level. Looks, performance and battery life  are the best as far as iPhone concerned. I’m a moderate user so battery easily lasts entire day even spare with 30 to 40%. I found one cons that is video call, battery get drain bit faster than android phones and signal quality is not up to the mark  but  once it get connected it won’t release the strength So it’s not a major issue. And cameras, just fall in love. Face unlocked in any light conditions. The biggest con is charging adopter 5w since iPhone 11 is beast of the mobile world but don’t know why apple still not boxed 12w or above adopter. Finally my verdict is it’s a BEAST. Go for it.Thanks for Apple and Amazon.

  Switching from Andriod to iOS is a big change. Andriod provides lot of features but your privacy is big concern . What you serach on google appears on facebook and other apps. Whatever you do all other app knows. Now, with iphone no such issues. Its faster than my previous phone OP5T. Looks premium has awesome camera. But overpriced.

  Everything is good with this iPhone. Only one this disappointed me that there is no lighting connector inside the box while it is mentioned on the box. I didn’t return or replace this iPhone because it is not a big thing but it should be inside the box as mentioned

  Phone is a bit too big, I am not a great fan of large phones. Screen touch is smooth. Smoother than my other iPhones. Full screen is definitely helpful. Face recognition works like a charm, just look at the phone and it unlocks. Reads your eyes and facial features. Double click on the power button is a bit annoying to process payments.

  The phone is super quick, is intuitive to use, has good cameras and the battery easily lasts a day.The only grouse I have is the screen. While many may not have felt it, I surely felt shortchanged. I switched from a Samsung S10e to iphone 11. The s10e had a beautiful Oled screen, some notches above this one. Just couldn’t digest a mediocre screen on a phone that costs more than 60k.I was also able to compare the camera with that of the S10e, and the results were mixed. It took better selfie and portrait pics, but fell little short in rear camera pics. No doubt, it has a very good camera system but definitely doesn’t live up to the hype of ‘the best camera ever on a smartphone’.

  I bought this as my 6S had a deteriorated battery life. I found this phone to be so power-hungry that I have to keep my phone on battery saving mode and also keep location off to get through 24 hours without calls and videos. Extremely disappointed with 11.

  Been using an iPhone 7 since 3 years, so I upgraded to 11 when it came. This pricing of iPhone 11 and the 6000 discount by HDFC makes it a really good buy. Other discounts included, I got it at ~57K which is a great price considering a flagship Android still costs around 40K to 50K. And camera of this iPhone is a work of art. It is smooth, captures great colours, works with vivid detail. Overall, this was a good experience!

  Great performance, good battery life, syncs perfectly with other Apple devices, and takes great pictures. Just a year old, and seems to be the best value for money spent on any iphone currently available. Looks impressive - glass back and 99% screen coverage. There is nothing that an Apple user can complain about.

  The phone is the best in its class and has the best hardware. The waterproof ability is very helpful in today’s time as the phone can be washed under running water. The camera is great, voice quality, mic speakers and display are excellent. Now the prices are also about right and hence it makes it a great deal to buy.

  I switched back to iOS from Android after a lot of hesitation. I must say I am not disappointed and I am happy.While I understand apple restricts from a lot of things but then one must know and accept it before going for apple products.Technically it is certainly on the top. Camera quality is great, no lags, great design, battery life is very good and great build quality.I am a happy customer!

  I really like the performance while playing games, while shooting 4k videos, and the battery life. While the camera may be the best on a smartphone, sometimes i do prefer to use my professional camera, but for every other task, it is good.The video stabilisation is also the best on a smartphone but not quite on the same level as panasonic cameras.The screen, well i cant really tell any difference between this and a 1080 or 1440p screen, it's really good. The bezels on the side do stand out though (not bothered by the notch, that's functional),If you zoom out to the ultrawide while shooting videos, you do lose the good stabilisation.Overall it's a great product, it has the best processor, sufficient RAM that you won't notice, and it being an apple product will keep getting updates for a long time, making it a long lasting phone, the camera is the best in a smartphone and you will be happy using it. When you buy an apple product you pay for the software developments and updates that come with itEdit after 4 months: battery maximum capacity still at 100%, brightness might feel less in direct sunlight, I'm a heavy user but my phone lasts a whole day. If i go for an outing with photography or likewise in mind, I never have to worry about battery doing. Heavy apps like Lightroom do drain the battery somewhat.

  I used to hate Apple as I was an android user, a hardcore one intact. I had a Oneplus 3T. I used to think specs are the ultimate factor in a phone. I was mistaken. Though this phone has an LCD display below 1080p, it is gorgeous. You won’t notice and flaws or pixels. Apple deserves credit for this.Coming to the camera quality, OMG! The best smartphone camera, period. Video is buttery smooth! The battery life is also amazing.I’m not giving a 5 star just for the camera or the screen or for its amazing battery life.The game changer for me is iOS! Switching from android to iOS was hassle free and the operating system keeps on surprising me. It’s an experience and will leave you with a smile on your face. Delight, surprise, love and connection. That’s what Apple makes you feel.

  Good packing and received a brand new product only. Delighted with the white colour iPhone, looks a sort of creamy or marble. Though initially I was little hesitant to purchase this product online, the best offers tempted me to purchase. I got 128 gb variant for Rs.51,000 after various discounts then traded my present phone for around Rs.9000 separately. So the final purchasing price of mine was only Rs. 42,000 which is highly value for money. I’m curious why Appario Retail seller getting more negative reviews as I received mine in perfect condition. This is my 3rd apple product purchase with Amazon and I hope to associate with them in future. Amazon never disappoints their customers be it low cost to any premium products. Overall satisfied with the purchase!!

  Phone as such was fantastic. Excellent battery life on mediocre usage takes two days to come down to 10%. Very good camera quality.But the phone delivered to me was faulty. The mic on the bottom was not working properly. The opponent caller can’t hear the voice clearly. But Apple support guided on the problem and visited the service centre to get it rectified perfectly without any additional cost. Now everything is fine.

  Camera is working good. Taken better quality pics. Please don’t compare with other devices. iPhone is better performance with iconic operating systems iOS. Battery life is also good. Face recognition is excellent.

  Great iphone if you are looking for long term usage and durability, excellent cameras and performanceThe only con at this price is the charger provided is only 5 Watt takes a long time to charge even though the battery is small comparatively.If you are on budget and want to buy apple its the best value for money optionDisplay is still very good many people wont miss the oled from the pros.

   That's the video quality and that's the night mode camera. It's not that happening, apps keep crashing and don't spend too much hard earned money on these phone. You will also have face id issue, it will not recognize you half of the time, plus battery dies quickly

  Don't buy from Amazon when it comes to Apple or any high end product. It is extremely risky task, and most probably you will get refurbished or defective product.Better to buy from authentic Apple Store where you can also get some deals or just simply buy from Apple's website. Now it is functional in india.In order to save 5 to 9k you will end up risking rest of your money.

  Amazing performance. PUBGM Never ever lags. Not even a single frame drop. Smooth gameplay. I suggest you to play with battery saver on when playing games. It greatly improves battery performance. If you’re confused between XR or 11, Go for 11 if you can. It’s more future proof when it comes to performance. XR and XS MAX sometimes have a very little rendering when squads come close to you. It may become a frame drop in the coming years. So go for the latest and more powerful processor. And camera is too good.

  After using iPhone 11 for about a month, I am writing this review. So please read.When you are on shopping for a premium phone, you should look for a few important things, especially spending so much money on a device.1. The brand value. Ultimately you should be proud to take your phone out in between a crowd2. Super features. especially the camera3. Beautiful looks.All of the above are satisfied with this phone. And there is no reason one should not buy this phone. Not convinced? Read on my full review.=== Camera ===I used Samsung S series since S2 and switched to Note series since Note 5 till Note 9. So this time I switched the brand and I don't regret. Compare to my Note 9 cameras, iPhone 11 cameras are far superior in terms of taking selfies or regular photos. Just point your subject and instantly focuses on the subject and the background will be blurred like the pro-grade camera. My friends don't believe that the photos taken are on a phone and not DSLR. That itself says all.=== Screen ===Not a super sensitive screen like the super awesome AMOLED one on my Note 9, but it doesn't fall behind as well. The screen is super responsive and shows the colors accurately. However, it feels smaller compared to my Note 9 screen or even iPhone 11 Pro. I don't say this screen is the ultimate screen but is very good at this price point. If you want an ultimate screen, go for the iPhone 11 Pro which has OLED screen.=== Software ===This is the pain point. After using Android for so many years, you will feel very inconvenient with iOS. But once you started using it, you will find it easy. Just a word of caution: If you are using Whatsapp, you will lose all your existing chats and data. There is no way to migrate your data from Android to iPhone. The only possible way is buying third party software which costs $20 dollars and that too does not work 100% correct. So be prepared to lose your WhatsApp data before migration.=== App Ecosystem ===Nothing to complain here. Everything available on Android is also there on iOS and to be frank more than Android. So this is one of the plus points. But the minus point is - all iOS developers want to milk money out of users. Some apps/games which are free on Android are paid on iOS.=== Services ===If you are an avid user of Google services, you find something missing or uncomfortable in using their services. Android so much integrated with Google services such as GMail, Drive, Maps, Photos and so on; you will find all of them on iOS but are no so much integrated.  My suggestion is to switch to Apple services wherever possible.=== Battery ===The battery lasts the whole day and is one of the best. However, the charger that comes with the phone is a low end charger. It won't have a quick charging facility. So I started using my Note 9 charger which works better.So that's all about my journey so far with the amazing iPhone 11.

  ♦️Pros :🔹️Super fast processor & OS as ever.🔹️Excellent battery backup due to efficient power consumption.🔹️Superb ultra wide camera with natural colors.🔹️ Extremely tough glass protection.🔹️ Zoom in picture with audio.But .........♦️Cons weigh more :🔸️Ugly looking camera setup with no depth sensor & protuded camera lens.🔸️ Too wide form factor & size to hold especially when you compare it to Samsung S10 line up with so sleek & sophisticated feel.🔸️Ugly looking front screen with a very wide notch at the top for selfie camera.🔸️Super amoled is much better in contrast & sunshine legibility.🔸️Too costly for the worth offered.🤏 Final verdict :*********************I suppose apple has completely lost its way in producing any innovative technology or design and just keeps repeating same looks and form factor since apple iphone7.Absolutely No appeal for the overpriced device.

  Have used iphone (4s and 6s plus) for last 9 years. Did not find anything exciting in this phone for price being paid now. No noted features compared to my old iphone, except larger screen size and better camera.At this price, one can rather buy Samsung S10 lite (SD 855), Bose soundlink mini, decent true wireless earphones and solid case (like Ringke, Spigen) and screen guard for phone.Switching to Android due to price and features given in iPhones now.Samsung S10 lite is very decent phone with Snapdragon processor. Photo quality of Samsung S10 lite is same as iPhone 11, and both run for atleast 4 years (based on usage) with good customer support.NO CHINESE PHONES DUE TO THEIR SERVICE AND PRODUCT LONGEVITY....

  After lot of reviews I went for this mobile and completely satisfied.. most of the ppl reviewed the screen quality is poor but I used led screens from Samsung mobiles and I felt not much issues with this phone.. of course there will be differences between led n this screen but this is something different from normal lcd screen .. display quality is good u won’t feel difference in day to day use..Also battery n performance is mind blowing.. I am moderate used about 4 hrs onscreen time n Battery  last for about one n half days easy..sound quality is amazing.. camera no need to say best in class.,Initially Only slight concern for me was thick bezels but after few days it got used to it..Overall great product from apple n I strongly recommend  this product and suggest to get at least 128 gb or more so no tension while shooting high quality Video.11 pro series are about 50K more than this product n have few advantages over this..Hence value for money product when compared to pro series ..This phone  will get good deal during annual sale , so wait for it and grab one..👍👍And last this is last product from apple with lcd screen hence anyone has issues with led flickering screen viewing then best option is this product..

  When you forget about the display resolution,you can’t say it is a average display while looking into it.apple make the best lcd panel.battery life is all day with moderate to heavy use.camera is superb.face recognition is just awesome.using for more than 7 months now. No lag,no problem. One has to use iphone for few days to see how fantastic,buttery smooth and easily to use iphone is. I bet one will never go back to android ever. Mind you its pricey but one can be assured for next 3 years its a peace of mind.

  I upgraded from iphone XR to iphone 11 and bought it for 63k and now its going cheap to 46k. But quality is not even worth 30k. While using apps phone heats up and app crashes. Gaming makes phone heat a lot and it crashes. Before iphone XR I had samsung s10 and i must say android phones are far superior in terms of performance. Apple iphone is just a low spec phone with lot of created Hype. And last but not least its stock clearance sale bcoz upcoming phones are 5g phones. Don't expect much from this phone. Only if you use phone like feature phone just to take calls and do little internet surfing than go ahead and buy it at a price of high spec phone
